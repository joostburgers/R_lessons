23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Ludovick stretched his own well-kept golden body and rejoiced in the,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"knowing that he was a man and not a Belphin. Immediately afterward,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,he was sorry for the heartless thought. Didn't the Belphins work only,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"to serve humanity? How ungrateful, then, it was to gloat over them!",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Besides, he comforted himself, probably, if the truth were known, the",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Belphins _liked_ to work. He hailed a passing Belphin for assurance on,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,this point.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Courteous, like all members of his species, the creature leaped from",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the street and listened attentively to the young man's question. ""We",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Belphins have but one like and one dislike,"" he replied. ""We like what",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"is right and we dislike what is wrong.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""But how can you tell what is right and what is wrong?"" Ludovick",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,persisted.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""We _know_,"" the Belphin said, gazing reverently across the city to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the blue spire of the tower where The Belphin of Belphins dwelt, in",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"constant communication with every member of his race at all times,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"""But _who_ placed you in charge,"" Ludovick asked, ""and whence _did_",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"you come?"" Fearing he might seem motivated by vulgar curiosity, he",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,A lifetime spent under their gentle guardianship had made Ludovick,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,able to interpret the expression that flitted across this Belphin's,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"frontispiece as a sad, sweet smile.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""We come from beyond the stars,"" he said. Ludovick already knew that;",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"he had hoped for something a little more specific. ""We were placed in",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,power by those who had the right. And the power through which we rule,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"is the power of love! Be happy!""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"And with that conventional farewell (which also served as a greeting),",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,he stepped onto the sidewalk and was borne off. Ludovick looked after,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"him pensively for a moment, then shrugged. Why _should_ the Belphins",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,surrender their secrets to gratify the idle curiosity of a poet?,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Ludovick packed his portable scriptwriter in its case and went to call,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"on the girl next door, whom he loved with a deep and intermittently",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,requited passion.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,As he passed between the tall columns leading into the Flockhart,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"courtyard, he noted with regret that there were quite a number of",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Corisande's relatives present, lying about sunning themselves and",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,sipping beverages which probably touched the legal limit of,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,intoxicatability.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Much as he hated to think harshly of anyone, he did not like Corisande",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Flockhart's relatives. He had never known anybody who had as many,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"relatives as she did, and sometimes he suspected they were not all",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,related to her. Then he would dismiss the thought as unworthy of him or,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,any right-thinking human being. He loved Corisande for herself alone,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,and not for her family. Whether they were actually her family or not,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,was none of his business.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Be happy!"" he greeted the assemblage cordially, sitting down beside",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Corisande on the tessellated pavement.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Bah!"" said old Osmond Flockhart, Corisande's grandfather. Ludovick was",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"sure that, underneath his crustiness, the gnarled patriarch hid a heart",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"of gold. Although he had been mining assiduously, the young man had not",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"yet been able to strike that vein; however, he did not give up hope,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,for not giving up hope was one of the principles that his wise old,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Belphin teacher had inculcated in him. Other principles were to lead,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,the good life and keep healthy.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Now, Grandfather,"" Corisande said, ""no matter what your politics, that",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"does not excuse impoliteness.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Ludovick wished she would not allude so blatantly to politics, because",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"he had a lurking notion that Corisande's ""family"" was, in fact, a band",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,of conspirators ... such as still dotted the green and pleasant planet,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,and proved by their existence that Man was not advancing anywhere,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,within measurable distance of that totality of knowledge implied by,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,the Belphin.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"You could tell malcontents, even if they did not voice their",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"dissatisfactions, by their faces. The vast majority of the human race,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"living good and happy lives, had smooth and pleasant faces. Malcontents'",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"faces were lined and sometimes, in extreme cases, furrowed. Everyone",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"could easily tell who they were by looking at them, and most people",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,avoided them.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"It was not that griping was illegal, for the Belphins permitted free",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,speech and reasonable conspiracy; it was that such behavior was,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,considered ungenteel. Ludovick would never have dreamed of associating,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"with this set of neighbors, once he had discovered their tendencies,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,had he not lost his heart to the purple-eyed Corisande at their first,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,meeting.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Politeness, bah!"" old Osmond said. ""To see a healthy young man",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"simply--simply accepting the status quo!""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""If the status quo is a good status quo,"" Ludovick said uneasily, for",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"he did not like to discuss such subjects, ""why should I not accept it?",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"We have everything we could possibly want. What do we lack?""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Our freedom,"" Osmond retorted.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""But we _are_ free,"" Ludovick said, perplexed. ""We can say what we",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"like, do what we like, so long as it is consonant with the public",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"good.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"""Ah, but who determines what is consonant with the public good?""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"Ludovick could no longer temporize with truth, even for Corisande's",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"sake. ""Look here, old man, I have read books. I know about the old days",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,before the Belphins came from the stars. Men were destroying themselves,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"quickly through wars, or slowly through want. There is none of that any",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"more.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""All lies and exaggeration,"" old Osmond said. ""_My_ grandfather told me",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"that, when the Belphins took over Earth, they rewrote all the textbooks",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,to suit their own purposes. Now nothing but Belphin propaganda is,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"taught in the schools.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""But surely some of what they teach about the past must be true,""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Ludovick insisted. ""And today every one of us has enough to eat and",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"drink, a place to live, beautiful garments to wear, and all the time in",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,the world to utilize as he chooses in all sorts of pleasant activities.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""They've taken away our frontiers!""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Behind his back, Corisande made a little filial face at Ludovick.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Ludovick tried to make the old man see reason. ""But I'm happy. And",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"everybody is happy, except--except a few _killjoys_ like you.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""They certainly did a good job of brainwashing you, boy,"" Osmond",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"each succeeding generation, more of our heritage is lost."" He patted",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the girl's hand. ""You're a good girl, Corrie. You don't hold with this",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"""Never mind Osmond, Eversole,"" one of Corisande's alleged uncles",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"grinned. ""He talks a lot, but of course he doesn't mean a quarter of",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,He handed a glass to Ludovick. Ludovick sipped and coughed. It tasted,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"as if it were well above the legal alcohol limit, but he didn't like to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"say anything. They were taking an awful risk, though, doing a thing",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"like that. If they got caught, they might receive a public",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"scolding--which was, of course, no more than they deserved--but he",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,could not bear to think of Corisande exposed to such an ordeal.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""It's only reasonable,"" the uncle went on, ""that older people should",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"have a--a thing about being governed by foreigners.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Ludovick smiled and set his nearly full glass down on a plinth. ""You",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,could hardly call the Belphins foreigners; they've been on Earth longer,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"than even the oldest of us.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""You seem to be pretty chummy with 'em,"" the uncle said, looking",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,narrow-eyed at Ludovick.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"""No more so than any other loyal citizen,"" Ludovick replied.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,The uncle sat up and wrapped his arms around his thick bare legs. He,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"was a powerful, hairy brute of a creature who had not taken advantage",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,of the numerous cosmetic techniques offered by the benevolent Belphins.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Don't you think it's funny they can breathe our air so easily?""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Why shouldn't they?"" Ludovick bit into an apple that Corisande handed",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,him from one of the dishes of fruit and other delicacies strewn about,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the courtyard. ""It's excellent air,"" he continued through a full mouth,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""especially now that it's all purified. I understand that in the old",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"days----""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Yes,"" the uncle said, ""but don't you think it's a coincidence they",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"breathe exactly the same kind of air we do, considering they claim to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"come from another solar system?""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""No coincidence at all,"" said Ludovick shortly, no longer able to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,pretend he didn't know what the other was getting at. He had heard the,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"ugly rumor before. Of course sacrilege was not illegal, but it was in",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"bad taste. ""Only one combination of elements spawns intelligent life.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""They say,"" the uncle continued, impervious to Ludovick's unconcealed",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"dislike for the subject, ""that there's really only one Belphin, who",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"lives in the Blue Tower--in a tank or something, because he can't",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,breathe our atmosphere--and that the others are a sort of robot he,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"sends out to do his work for him.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Nonsense!"" Ludovick was goaded to irritation at last. ""How could a",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"realized now, from the sad fate of Mieczyslaw and George, were",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"But Ludovick could not be happy. He wasn't precisely sad yet, but he",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"was thoughtful. Of course the Belphins knew better than he did, but",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,still.... Perhaps they underestimated the seriousness of the Flockhart,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"conspiracy. On the other hand, perhaps it was he who was taking the",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Flockharts too seriously. Maybe he should investigate further before,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,doing anything rash.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Later that night, he slipped over to the Flockhart villa and nosed",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,Corisande gave a rippling laugh as she twirled her glittering pendant.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"At that moment, Ludovick stumbled over a jug which some careless",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"the tesserae, spattering Ludovick's legs and sandals with a liquid",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,which later proved to be extremely red wine.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""There's someone outside!"" the uncle declared, half-rising.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Nonsense!"" Corisande said, putting her hand on his shoulder. ""I didn't",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"hear anything.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"The uncle looked dubious, and Ludovick thought it prudent to withdraw",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"at this point. Besides, he had heard enough. Corisande--his Corisande--was",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,an integral part of the conspiracy.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,He lay down to sleep that night beset by doubts. If he told the,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Belphins about the conspiracy, he would be betraying Corisande. As a",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"matter of fact, he now remembered, he _had_ already told them about",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,the conspiracy and they hadn't believed him. But supposing he could,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"_convince_ them, how could he give Corisande up to them? True, it was",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the right thing to do--but, for the first time in his life, he could",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"not bring himself to do what he knew to be right. He was weak, weak--and",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"weakness was sinful. His old Belphin teacher had taught him that, too.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"As Ludovick writhed restlessly upon his bed, he became aware that",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"""Ludovick,"" a soft, beloved voice whispered, ""I have come to ask your",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Now that the amenities were over, she resumed, ""Against my will, I have",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,been involved in the family plot. My uncle has invented a secret weapon,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"which he believes will counteract the power of the barriers.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""But I thought you devised it!""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""So it _was_ you in the courtyard. Well, what happened was I wanted to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"gain time, so I said I had a secret weapon of my own invention which I",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"had not perfected, but which would cost considerably less than my",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"uncle's model. We have to watch the budget, you know, because we can",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,hardly expect the Belphins to supply the components for this job.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Anyhow, I thought that, while my folks were waiting for me to finish",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"it, you would have a chance to warn the Belphins.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Corisande,"" he murmured, ""you are as noble and clever as you are",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"Then he caught the full import of her remarks. ""_Me!_ But they won't",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"pay any attention to me!""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""How do you know?"" When he remained silent, she said, ""I suppose you've",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"already tried to warn them about us.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""That was good of you."" She continued in a warmer tone: ""How many",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Belphins did you warn, then?""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Just one. When you tell one something, you tell them all. You know",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""That's just theory,"" she said. ""It's never been proven. All we do know",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"is that they have some sort of central clearing house of information,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,presumably The Belphin of Belphins. But we don't know that they are,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,incapable of thinking or acting individually. We don't really know much,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Next morning, he set out to warn Belphins. He knew it wasn't much use,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,but it was all he could do. The first half dozen responded in much the,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"same way the Belphin he had warned the previous day had done, by",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,courteously acknowledging his solicitude and assuring him there was no,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,need for alarm; they knew all about the Flockharts and everything would,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,be all right.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"After that, they started to get increasingly huffy--which would, he",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"thought, substantiate the theory that they were all part of one vast",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,coordinate network of identity. Especially since each Belphin behaved,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,as if Ludovick had been repeatedly annoying _him_.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Finally, they refused to get off the walks when he hailed them--which",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"was unheard of, for no Belphin had ever before failed to respond to an",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Earthman's call--and when he started running along the walks after,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"them, they ran much faster than he could.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"At last he gave up and wandered about the city for hours, speaking to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"neither human nor Belphin, wondering what to do. That is, he knew what",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,he had to do; he was wondering _how_ to do it. He would never be able,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,to reach The Belphin of Belphins. No human being had ever done it.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Mieczyslaw and George had died trying to reach him (or it). Even though,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"their intentions had been hostile and Ludovick's would be helpful,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,there was little chance he would be allowed to reach The Belphin with,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,all the other Belphins against him. What guarantee was there that The,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Belphin would not be against him, too?",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,And yet he knew that he would have to risk his life; there was no help,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"for it. He had never wanted to be a hero, and here he had heroism",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"thrust upon him. He knew he could not succeed; equally well, he knew he",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"could not turn back, for his Belphin teacher had instructed him in the",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,meaning of duty.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,It was twilight when he approached the Blue Tower. Commending himself,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"to the Infinite Virtue, he entered. The Belphin at the reception desk",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"did not give off the customary smiling expression. In fact, he seemed",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,to radiate a curiously apprehensive aura.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Go back, young man,"" he said. ""You're not wanted here.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""I must see The Belphin of Belphins. I must warn him against the",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,Suddenly this particular Belphin lost his commanding manners. He began,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"to wilt, insofar as so rigidly constructed a creature could go limp.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""Please, we've done so much for you. Do this for us.""",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"""The Belphin of Belphins did things for us,"" Ludovick countered. ""You",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,are all only his followers. How do I know you are _really_ following,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"Without giving the creature a chance to answer, he strode forward.",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,The Belphin attempted to bar his way. Ludovick knew one Belphin was,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"a myriad times as strong as a human, so it was out of utter futility",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,that he struck.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"The Belphin collapsed completely, flying apart in a welter of fragile",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"knew, but he was too numbed by his incredible success to be able to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,think clearly. All he knew was that The Belphin would be able to,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,explain things to him.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"seemingly enjoying their carefree lives, now declared themselves to",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"Belphin was dead, all the machinery that had been operated by him",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"stopped and no one knew how to fix it. The sidewalks stopped moving,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"the air conditioners stopped conditioning, the food synthesizers",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"stopped synthesizing, and so on. And, of course, everybody blamed it",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,all on Ludovick--even that year's run of bad weather.,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"There were famines, riots, plagues, and, after the waves of mob hostility",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

23104,"In the second place, Ludovick could never forget that, when Corisande",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"had sent him to the Blue Tower, she could not have been sure that her",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,"secret weapon would work. Love might _not_ have conquered all--in fact,",The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,it was the more likely hypothesis that it wouldn't--and he would have,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."
23104,been killed by the first barrier. And no husband likes to think that,The Blue Tower,"Smith, Evelyn E."

29791,upon his head made apparent the grey that usually blended into the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."

29791,"he was doing--fulfilling childhood desires, nothing more?",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Fortunately Clifford didn't realize that he had scored, and scuttled",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"back to the shelter of the _Manual_. ""Perhaps you don't know enough",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"about the new system in Alpha Centauri,"" he said, a trifle wildly. ""It",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"has two suns surrounded by three planets, Thalia, Aglaia, and",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Euphrosyne. Each of these planets is slightly smaller than Earth, so",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"that the decrease in gravity is just great enough to be pleasant,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,without being so marked as to be inconvenient. The atmosphere is almost,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"exactly like that of Earth's, except that it contains several beneficial",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,elements which are absent here--and the climate is more temperate. Owing,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,to the fact that the planets are partially shielded from the suns by,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"cloud layers, the temperature--except immediately at the poles and the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"equators, where it is slightly more extreme--is always equable,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"resembling that of Southern California....""",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""Sounds charming,"" said Johnson. ""I too have read the Colonial Office",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,handouts.... I wonder what the people who wrote them'll do now that,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,there's no longer any necessity for attracting colonists--everybody's,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"already up in Alpha Centauri. Oh, well; there'll be other systems to",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"conquer and colonize.""",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""The word _conquer_ is hardly correct,"" the commander said stiffly,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""since not one of the three planets had any indigenous life forms that",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"was intelligent.""",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""Or life forms that you recognized as intelligent,"" Johnson suggested",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,gently. Although why should there be such a premium placed on,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"intelligence, he wondered. Was intelligence the sole criterion on which",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,the right to life and to freedom should be based?,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"The commander frowned and looked at his chronometer again. ""Well,"" he",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"finally said, ""since you feel that way and you're sure you've quite made",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."

29791,amount of reproach.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Clifford flushed and started to walk away.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""I'll stand out of the way of your jets!"" Johnson called after him. ""It",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,would be so anticlimactic to have me burned to a crisp after all this.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Bon voyage!""",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,There was no reply.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Johnson watched the silver vessel shoot up into the sky and thought,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"""Now is the time for me to feel a pang, or even a twinge, but I don't at",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"all. I feel relieved, in fact, but that's probably the result of getting",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"rid of that fool Clifford.""",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"He crossed the field briskly, pulling off his jacket and discarding his",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,tie as he went. His ground car remained where he had parked it--in an,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,area clearly marked _No Parking_.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,They'd left him an old car that wasn't worth shipping to the stars. How,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,long it would last was anybody's guess. The government hadn't been,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,deliberately illiberal in leaving him such a shabby vehicle; if there,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"had been any way to ensure a continuing supply of fuel, they would",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"probably have left him a reasonably good one. But, since only a little",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"could be left, allowing him a good car would have been simply an example",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"of conspicuous waste, and the government had always preferred its waste",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,to be inconspicuous.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"He drove slowly through the broad boulevards of Long Island, savoring",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,the loneliness. New York as a residential area had been a ghost town for,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"years, since the greater part of its citizens had been among the first",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"to emigrate to the stars. However, since it was the capital of the world",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,and most of the interstellar ships--particularly the last few--had,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"taken off from its spaceports, it had been kept up as an official",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"embarkation center. Thus, paradoxically, it was the last city to be",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"completely evacuated, and so, although the massive but jerry-built",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"apartment houses that lined the streets were already crumbling, the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,roads had been kept in fairly good shape and were hardly cracked at all.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Still, here and there the green was pushing its way up in unlikely",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"places. A few more of New York's tropical summers, and Long Island would",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,soon become a wilderness.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"The streets were empty, except for the cats sunning themselves on",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,long-abandoned doorsteps or padding about on obscure errands of their,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,own. Perhaps their numbers had not increased since humanity had left the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"city to them, but there certainly seemed to be more--striped and solid,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,black and grey and white and tawny--accepting their citizenship with,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,equanimity. They paid no attention to Johnson--they had long since,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,dissociated themselves from a humanity that had not concerned itself,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"greatly over their welfare. On the other hand, neither he nor the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"surface car appeared to startle them; the old ones had seen such before,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,and to kittens the very fact of existence is the ultimate surprise.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,The Queensborough Bridge was deadly silent. It was completely empty,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,except for a calico cat moving purposefully toward Manhattan. The,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"structure needed a coat of paint, Johnson thought vaguely, but of course",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"it would never get one. Still, even uncared for, the bridges should",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,outlast him--there would be no heavy traffic to weaken them. Just in,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"case of unforeseeable catastrophe, however--he didn't want to be trapped",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"on an island, even Manhattan Island--he had remembered to provide",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"himself with a rowboat; a motorboat would have been preferable, but then",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,the fuel difficulty would arise again....,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,How empty the East River looked without any craft on it! It was rather a,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"charming little waterway in its own right, though nothing to compare",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,with the stately Hudson. The water scintillated in the sunshine and the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"air was clear and fresh, for no factories had spewed fumes and smoke",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"into it for many years. There were few gulls, for nothing was left for",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,the scavenger; those remaining were forced to make an honest living by,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,catching fish.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"In Manhattan, where the buildings had been more soundly constructed, the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"signs of abandonment were less evident ... empty streets, an occasional",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"cracked window. Not even an unusual amount of dirt because, in the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"past, the normal activities of an industrial and ruggedly individual",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,city had provided more grime than years of neglect could ever hope to,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"equal. No, it would take Manhattan longer to go back than Long Island.",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Perhaps that too would not happen during his lifetime.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Yet, after all, when he reached Fifth Avenue he found that Central Park",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"had burst its boundaries. Fifty-ninth Street was already half jungle,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,and the lush growth spilled down the avenues and spread raggedly out,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"into the side streets, pushing its way up through the cracks it had made",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,in the surface of the roads. Although the Plaza fountain had not flowed,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"for centuries, water had collected in the leaf-choked basin from the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"last rain, and a group of grey squirrels were gathered around it,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,shrilly disputing possession with some starlings.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Except for the occasional cry of a cat in the distance, these voices",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,were all that he heard ... the only sound. Not even the sudden blast of,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,a jet regaining power ... he would never hear that again; never hear the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,stridor of a human voice piercing with anger; the cacophony of a hundred,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"television sets, each playing a different program; the hoot of a horn;",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"off-key singing; the thin, uncertain notes of an amateur musician ...",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,these would never be heard on Earth again.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,He sent the car gliding slowly ... no more traffic rules ... down Fifth,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Avenue. The buildings here also were well-built; they were many,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,centuries old and would probably last as many more. The shop windows,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"were empty, except for tangles of dust ... an occasional broken,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,discarded mannequin.... In some instances the glass had already cracked,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"or fallen out. Since there were no children to throw stones, however,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"others might last indefinitely, carefully glassing in nothingness. Doors",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,stood open and he could see rows of empty counters and barren shelves,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,fuzzed high with the dust of the years since a customer had approached,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,them.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Cats sedately walked up and down the avenue or sat genteelly with tails,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,tucked in on the steps of the cathedral--as if the place had been theirs,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,all along.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"Dusk was falling. Tonight, for the first time in centuries, the street",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,lamps would not go on. Undoubtedly when it grew dark he would see,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"ghosts, but they would be the ghosts of the past and he had made his",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,peace with the past long since; it was the present and the future with,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"which he had not come to terms. And now there would be no present, no",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"past, no future--but all merged into one and he was the only one.",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,At Forty-second Street pigeons fluttered thickly around the public,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"library, fat as ever, their numbers greater, their appetites grosser.",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"The ancient library, he knew, had changed little inside: stacks and",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,shelves would still be packed thick with reading matter. Books are,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"bulky, so only the rare editions had been taken beyond the stars; the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,rest had been microfilmed and their originals left to Johnson and decay.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"It was his library now, and he had all the time in the world to read all",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,the books in the world--for there were more than he could possibly read,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"in the years that, even at the most generous estimate, were left to him.",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"He had been wondering where to make his permanent residence for, with",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"the whole world his, he would be a fool to confine himself to some",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,modest dwelling. Now he fancied it might be a good idea to move right,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,into the library. Very few places in Manhattan could boast a garden of,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,their own.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,He stopped the car to stare thoughtfully at the little park behind the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"grimy monument to Neoclassicism. Like Central Park, Bryant had already",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,slipped its boundaries and encroached upon Sixth Avenue--Avenue of the,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"World, the street signs said now, and before that it had been Avenue of",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"the Nations and Avenue of the Americas, but to the public it had always",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"been Sixth Avenue and to Johnson, the last man on Earth, it was Sixth",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Avenue.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"He'd live in the library, while he stayed in New York, that was--he'd",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"thought that in a few weeks, when it got really hot, he might strike",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,north. He had always meant to spend a summer in Canada. His surface car,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"would probably never last the trip, but the Museum of Ancient Vehicles",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,had been glad to bestow half a dozen of the bicycles from their exhibits,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"upon him. After all, he was, in effect, a museum piece himself and so as",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"worth preserving as the bicycles; moreover, bicycles are difficult to",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"pack for an interstellar trip. With reasonable care, these might last",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,him his lifetime....,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"But he had to have a permanent residence somewhere, and the library was",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"an elegant and commodious dwelling, centrally located. New York would",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"have to be his headquarters, for all the possessions he had carefully",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,amassed and collected and begged and--since money would do him no good,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"any more--bought, were here. And there were by far too many of them to",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,be transported to any really distant location. He loved to own things.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,He was by no means an advocate of Rousseau's complete return to nature;,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"whatever civilization had left that he could use without compromise, he",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"would--and thankfully. There would be no electricity, of course, but he",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,had provided himself with flashlights and bulbs and batteries--not too,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"many of the last, of course, because they'd grow stale. However, he'd",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,also laid in plenty of candles and a vast supply of matches.... Tins of,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"food and concentrates and synthetics, packages of seed should he grow",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"tired of all these and want to try growing his own--fruit, he knew,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"would be growing wild soon enough.... Vitamins and medicines--of course,",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"were he to get really ill or get hurt in some way, it might be the end",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,... but that was something he wouldn't think of--something that couldn't,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,possibly happen to him....,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"For his relaxation he had an antique hand-wound phonograph, together",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"with thousands of old-fashioned records. And then, of course, he had the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"whole planet, the whole world to amuse him.",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,He even had provided himself with a heat-ray gun and a substantial,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"supply of ammunition, although he couldn't imagine himself ever killing",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,an animal for food. It was squeamishness that stood in his way rather,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"than any ethical considerations, although he did indeed believe that",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"every creature had the right to live. Nonetheless, there was the",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,possibility that the craving for fresh meat might change his mind for,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"him. Besides, although hostile animals had long been gone from this part",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"of the world--the only animals would be birds and squirrels and, farther",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"up the Hudson, rabbits and chipmunks and deer ... perhaps an occasional",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."

29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,A cat sitting atop one of the stately stone lions outside the library,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"met his eye with such a steady gaze of understanding, though not of",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"sympathy, that he found himself needing to repeat the by-now almost",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"magic phrase to himself: ""Not in my lifetime anyway."" Would some",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,intelligent life form develop to supplant man? Or would the planet,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,revert to a primeval state of mindless innocence? He would never know,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,and he didn't really care ... no point in speculating over unanswerable,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,questions.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,He settled back luxuriously on the worn cushions of his car. Even so,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"little as twenty years before, it would have been impossible for",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,him--for anyone--to stop his vehicle in the middle of Forty-second,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,Street and Fifth Avenue purely to meditate. But it was his domain now.,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"He could go in the wrong direction on one-way streets, stop wherever he",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"pleased, drive as fast or as slowly as he would (and could, of course).",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"If he wanted to do anything as vulgar as spit in the street, he could",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"(but they were his streets now, not to be sullied) ... cross the roads",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"without waiting for the lights to change (it would be a long, long wait",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"if he did) ... go to sleep when he wanted, eat as many meals as he",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,wanted whenever he chose.... He could go naked in hot weather and,The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."
29791,"there'd be no one to raise an eyebrow, deface public buildings (except",The Most Sentimental Man,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,"find that uncomfortable. Students are students, whether they're",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,"Narli. Of course you're right. Human beings, from what I've read of",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,on Saturn. Narli Gzann had been chosen as first exchange professor,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,"between Saturn and Earth because of his academic reputation, not his",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,personality. But although the choosers had probably not had that aspect,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,"of the matter in mind, the choice, he thought, was a wise one.",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,"And he had accepted the post largely because he felt that, as an alien",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,"being, he would be left strictly alone. This would give him the chance",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,"to put in a lot of work on his definitive history of the Solar System, a",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,monumental project from which he begrudged all the time he had to spend,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,spending more than enough for bare subsistence he would be able to save,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,up a considerable amount and retire while still comparatively young. It,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31626,was pleasant to imagine a scholarly life unafflicted by students.,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,He could put up with a good deal for that goal.,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,"not consciously want to hurt the only person who, for some strange",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,he'd ever see any of his own kind again would make the affair almost,The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31626,"was, as a matter of fact, more than he had expected from a Terrestrial.",The Vilbar Party,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"All that night, Paul wrestled with his conscience. He knew he shouldn't",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,just let Ivo go on. Yet what else could he do? Go to the proper,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,authorities? But which authorities were the proper ones? And even if he,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"found them, who would believe an actor offstage, delivering such",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,improbable lines? He would either be laughed at or accused of being part,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,of a subversive plot. It might result in a lot of bad publicity which,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,could ruin his career.,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,So Paul did nothing about Ivo. He went back to the usual rounds of,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"agents' and producers' offices, and the knowledge of why Ivo was on",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,It was an exceptionally hot October--the kind of weather when sometimes,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,"against a stone wall, why he didn't get a job in a department store",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"somewhere or teaching school. And then he thought of the applause, the",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"curtain calls, the dream of some day seeing his name in lights above the",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,title of the play--and he knew he would never give up. Quitting the,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"theater would be like committing suicide, for off the stage he was alive",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"only technically. He was good; he knew he was good, so some day, he",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,Rehearsals took up so much of his time that he saw very little of Ivo,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,for the next five weeks--but by then Ivo didn't need him any more.,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"Actually, they were no longer teacher and pupil now but companions,",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,drawn together by the fact that they both belonged to different worlds,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,from the one in which they were living. Insofar as he could like anyone,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"who existed outside of his imagination, Paul had grown rather fond of",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"Ivo. And he rather thought Ivo liked him, too--but, because he couldn't",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,"he didn't come around very often. At first, Paul felt a twinge of guilt;",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,then he remembered that he need not worry. Ivo had his own work.,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,"Paul didn't see Ivo at all for six weeks. Busy, happy weeks they were,",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,for the play was a smash hit from the start. It played to packed houses,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,could pay attention to the strange things that had happened to his,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,"to occupy his mind. First of all, the producers of _The Holiday Tree_",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,could not resist the pressure of an adoring public; although the,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"original star sulked, three months after the play had opened in New",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"York, Paul's name went up in lights next to hers, _over the title of the",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,That was good. But then there was Gregory. And that was bad. Gregory was,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"Paul's understudy--a handsome, sullen youth who had, on numerous",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"occasions, been heard to utter words to the effect of: ""It's the part",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"that's so good, not him. If I had the chance to play Eric Everard just",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,"once, they'd give Lambrequin back to the Indians.""",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,Sometimes he had said the words in Paul's hearing; sometimes the remarks,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,"were enjoying a quiet smoke together, for there was no performance that",My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,of Ivo's mind until the Sunday before the Tuesday on which he was,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31648,planning to resume his role.,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31648,Of course Paul had known all along that Ivo was not a human being. It,My Fair Planet,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31664,,Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31664,Iversen pressed forward to see what fresh life-form the bulging cavity,Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31664,"toward Earth. Gloomy days passed, one after the other, during which no",Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31664,"in the mirror on his cabin wall, the captain realized that he was",Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31664,,Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31664,"And then one day, as he sat in his cabin reading the Spaceman's Credo,",Once a Greech,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"from them, calling, ""Yoo-hoo, Jrann-Pttt! Here is the frying pan!"" Algol",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"woke up instantly and followed her. ""Frying"" was one of the more",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,convince herself? Was there some reason the terrestrials had for needing,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,to like Venus. It hovered on the edge of the women's minds. If only it,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"he thought, _for they are the monsters themselves. But that would never",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"are the monsters.""",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,A sudden gust of wind nearly whipped the tablecloth out of Jrann-Pttt's,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"hands. He fought with it for a moment, glad of something tangible to",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"contend with. ""About the shelters,"" he said. ""They might not stand up",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"against a storm.""",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""So this is monsoon country,"" Bernardi observed thoughtfully. ""Do you",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"know when the storms usually come, Jrann-Pttt?"" The other shook his",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"""Storms here are bad, eh?"" the captain commented, swinging himself down",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"easily. ""Frankly, that worries me. Ship's resting on mud as far as I can",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"see, and if there's one thing I do know something about, it's mud. If it",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""Maybe we should leave,"" Mrs. Bernardi suggested. ""Go to another part of",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"There was a sudden silence, and Jrann-Pttt found himself able to pick up",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,the answers to some of his questions from the alien minds. His worst,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,fears were confirmed. Plan A was out. But something could still be done,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,with these creatures.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"""For you, perhaps,"" the captain retorted. ""Maybe not for us.""",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""Now that's silly,"" Miss Anspacher said. ""You can see that Jrann-Pttt is",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"""I don't mean that we could face it without protection,"" the captain",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"Laden with equipment and malevolent thoughts, the captain trudged off",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,into the murky jungle. The others would not even offer to help.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,Confounded scientists; they certainly took his status as captain,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"seriously. He wished, for a disloyal moment, that he had stayed on",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,Earth. The quiet routine of a test pilot had prepared him for nothing,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"like this. Were Miss Anspacher and adventure worth it? At the moment, he",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,thought not. But he was on Venus and it was too late to change his mind.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"Jrann-Pttt followed him into the jungle, keeping some distance behind,",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,for he had good reason to suspect that Greenfield would take his warm,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"interest in terrestrial technology for plain spying. Or, worse yet, he",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,might try to press the lizard-man into service; Jrann-Pttt felt he had,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,demeaned himself quite enough already.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""Have you noticed,"" Miss Anspacher asked, pushing the mass of damp brown",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,Jrann-Pttt halted. He had a good idea of what the captain's reactions to,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,the sight of himself and Miss Anspacher arriving hand-in-hand would be.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""Yes, it is getting rather overpowering. Perhaps, for a lady of your",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"you ... how quiet everything is!""",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"He had not noticed. For him, it would never be quiet because of the",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,stream of jangled thoughts constantly pouring into the back of his mind,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,from everything sentient that surrounded him.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"For a moment, he wondered what it would be like to be non-telepathic",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"like the terrestrials, to have peace from the clamor of confused",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"impressions, emotions and ideas that persistently beat at his mind. But",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"that would be wondering how it was to be deaf to avoid discord, or blind",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,to shut out ugliness.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"""The lull before the storm, I suppose,"" she said brightly. _Now is his",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"During their short absence, the citrine clouds that closed off the sky",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,had changed to a sinister umber. It was now almost as dusky in the,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"clearing as in the jungle itself, when Jrann-Pttt and Miss Anspacher",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,returned and joined the others.,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,Professor Bernardi stood looking up with sharp gray eyes at a sky he,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"As Jrann-Pttt hung the kettle over the fire, suddenly the air erupted in",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,stunning violence of sound. The ground undulated under their feet and,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"water slopped out of the kettle, almost putting out the fire that rose",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,"high to claw at it. Rivulets of thick, muddy liquid welled out of the",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

31686,"faint cry and hid under Mrs. Bernardi's skirts, trembling, while the",Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."
31686,mosquito-bat tried to lift Mortland's toupee and hide in his hair. The,Collector's Item,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"fabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!"" my middle brother's voice came muffled",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"through the folds. ""If you can't help, at least don't hinder!""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"be trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,mental grip.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I could help,"" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, ""if anybody",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"would let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"faster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Just then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"have walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,exhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"kid. Not that he looked his age--he was big and blond, like Danny and",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Tim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Boys, boys!"" he reproved us. ""Danny, you ought to be ashamed of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"yourself--picking on poor Kev.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Even if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Nobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"poor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"nicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,lost their tempers could I get--or so I believed--their true attitude,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,toward me.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,How else could I tell?,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Sorry, fella,"" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"on the table. ""Wrinkles,"" he grumbled to himself. ""Wrinkles. And I had",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"it so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,"" Father",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,reminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"telepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,was so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""But I think you'll find she understands.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""She knows, all right,"" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""but I'm not sure she always understands.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"because he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"""There are tensions in this room,"" my sister announced as she slouched",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"in, not quite awake yet, ""and hatred. I could feel them all the way",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"upstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"must feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"please.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,She sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,place; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"bumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,her shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"primitive, I couldn't help laughing.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Danny, you fumbler!"" she screamed.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Danny erupted from the kitchen. ""How many times have I asked all of you",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,not to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"interfering busybodies getting in the way.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I don't see why you have to set the table at all,"" she retorted. ""A",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"robot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could."" She",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"turned quickly toward me. ""Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,back of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia's face turned even whiter. ""Father, stop him--_stop_ him! He's",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"hating again! I can't stand it!""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Father looked at me, then at her. ""I don't think he can help it,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I grinned. ""That's right--I'm just a poor atavism with no control over",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"myself a-tall.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Finally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,woman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"the complete details, even though I quickly protested, ""It's illegal to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"probe anyone without permission.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"she said tartly, ""and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia--poor Kevin isn't responsible.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,She didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,out from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Danny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Mother's lips tightened. ""Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Kevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"A psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family--that is, not",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,officially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,than they could help having thumbnails.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""No use,"" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. ""Who can",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"adjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,"" my father",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"suggested hopefully. ""Maybe you should make an appointment for him at",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"the cure-all?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Mother shook her neatly coiffed head. ""He's been to it dozens of times",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,and he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"time to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,be allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"machine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Now that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"got sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Life was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"these days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,into it--which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"population. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"like me--psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"physical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"grafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"you could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,"" my",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,youngest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""You always do, Timothy,"" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. ""And I",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"must say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"He reached for his juice. ""Guess this is a doomed household. And what",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"was all that emotional uproar about?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""The usual,"" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"answer. She slid warily into her chair. ""Hey, Dan, I'm here!"" she",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"called. ""If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Oh, all right."" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,floating ahead of him.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""The usual? Trouble with Kev?"" Tim looked at me narrowly. ""Somehow my",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"sense of ominousness is connected with him.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Well, that's perfectly natural--"" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,caught her eye.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I didn't mean that,"" Tim said. ""I still say Kev's got something we",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"can't figure out.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""You've been saying that for years,"" Danny protested, ""and he's been",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,tested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,or telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"prepossess. He can't--""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,"" I interrupted, trying to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,keep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"family thought of me, I knew--as an animal, and not a very lovable one,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,either.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""No,"" Tim said, ""he's just got something we haven't developed a test",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"for. It'll come out some day, you'll see."" He smiled at me.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"really seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. ""It won't work, Tim.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I know you're trying to be kind, but--""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""He's not saying it just to be kind,"" my mother put in. ""He means it.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Not that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,"" she added with grim",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"scrupulousness. ""Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"extracurricular prognostications too far.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Nonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"After all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,wouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Bureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Mother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"me. As Danny had said, she _knew_ but she didn't really _understand_.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Nobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Breakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,various jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared--he was,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,a traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"continent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"the helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,psychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Dan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,promotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,pianos.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Only I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"were certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"would have none of them--partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,their own community standing.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,"" my father always",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"said. ""I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"care of the house.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,And that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"techno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"those things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"down, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,robots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"constructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,a career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,could be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"my family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,they would just do it all over again when they got home.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,So I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"take books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,couldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,telepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,if he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"nothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"get awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,hundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"tapes, but they also bored me after a while.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,which would classify me as a telesensitive--artistic ability being,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"considered as the oldest, if least important, psi power--but I couldn't",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,even do anything like that.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,About all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,out of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,want to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"and were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"were saying to one another when I hove into sight. ""There's that oldest",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Faraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,attracted to me--I could see that--they could hardly go out with me,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"without exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"done the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago--before people,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,started playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,radiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,latent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"don't know why I say _we_--in 1960 or so, I might have been considered",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"useful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"a niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,geared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"time I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"barren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"drastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,had been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"stars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,couldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"around--not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,wasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"in me. Tim must be right, I thought--I must have some undreamed-of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,power that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,that power?,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,explored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,productive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"As I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"nothing more than what I seemed to be--a simple psi-negative. Yet, from",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"time to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,knowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,psi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,liked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Even gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"home in those woodland--or, rather, pseudo-woodland--surroundings,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,able to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,with my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,sympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"household, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"noses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,as well as extrasensory imbecility.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,than I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,They seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,This was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"enthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"left, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"There hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,we hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,techniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,with reinforcements--if such were its intention--in less than six,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"months. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,aliens' armament.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,They might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"be powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"of telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"to pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,It's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"techniques. And you too, Kevin,"" she added, obviously a little",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"surprised herself at what she was saying. ""Probably you'd be even",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"pain.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I looked at her.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"""It _is_ an ill wind,"" she agreed, smiling wryly, ""but don't let me",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"that there should be no war and you should remain useless?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,talent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,usually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"one, I was necessarily devoid of the other.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"My attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,aliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation--even,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"the 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,was entirely different from ours--and the war was on.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,worked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"aren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"abilities--normal human abilities, rather.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Gee, Mr. Faraday,"" one of the other students breathed, ""you're so",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"strong. And without 'kinesis or anything.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. ""My",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"name's not Mr. Faraday,"" I said. ""It's Kevin.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""My name's Lucy,"" she giggled.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,No girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"started to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,when I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,tourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,unconcern.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Hey, quit that!"" the windee yelled. ""You're making it too tight! I'll",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"be mortified!""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,So Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,a low-grade telesensitive--just a poetess--so I had nothing to worry,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,about as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"got interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"she was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,a position herself.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"However, when the actual bombs--or their alien equivalent--struck near",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"our town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"carrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,a hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene--I had,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"never seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,of fact--and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,way. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,talent for prognostication.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,the _you_.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"She gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. ""Go on--now's your",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"chance to show you're of some use in this world.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Gritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"pretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"right place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"eye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,face again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,if some super-psi had plucked them from me.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,The man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"that before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"wet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,so hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"wound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"even my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Mother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,could hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"patient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,no wound at all--just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,again. Not even a scar.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Wha--wha happened?"" he asked. ""It doesn't hurt any more!""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,He touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"was frightened, too--too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,anything but stare witlessly at him.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Touch some of the others, quick!"" my mother commanded, pushing",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,astounded attendants away from stretchers.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,were whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,the way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"shutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"thing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,imagined all those horrors.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,But the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"almost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"There was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"seeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"would have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"I should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"had read. ""Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,deficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"and not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,effectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,just for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,world and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,wouldn't be able to do even that.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"When I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Lucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. ""I'm",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"your assistant, Kev,"" she said shyly.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I looked at her. ""You are?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I--I hope you want me,"" she went on, coyness now mixing with",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,apprehension.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I gave her shoulder a squeeze. ""I do want you, Lucy. More than I can",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"tell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"say. But right now--"" I clapped her arm--""there's a job to be done.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Yes, Kevin,"" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,time to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,waiting for me.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"They gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"sleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"show my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"thoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"powers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"that, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"disfigured. In a sense, they were--well, my children; I felt a warm",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,glow of affection toward them.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,They felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"hospital soon leaked out--during all those years of peace, the",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,government had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets--and,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"people used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,The government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,attract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Earth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,human race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,it was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,they wanted to risk me.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Plenty of people did come to see me officially--the President,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"generals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,obsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,began to love everybody.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Lucy asked me one day.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"I gave her an incredulous glance. ""You mean I shouldn't help people?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Just ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Why shouldn't I be?"" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. ""Are",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"you jealous, Lucy?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"She lowered her eyes. ""Not only that, but the war's bound to come to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"an end, you know, and--""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"It was the first part of her sentence that interested me. ""Why, do you",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"mean--""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,And just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"them. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,have the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Then, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"that the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,were not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,light-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"and blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,equivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,the Centaurians again.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Peace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary--only,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,the Vice President this time--had thanked me on behalf of a grateful,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"For a while, I was glad to be back home. I was a celebrity. People",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"dropped in from all around to see me and talk to me. And my family,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"basking in the reflection of glory, was nice to me ... for a while.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I don't have any trouble making appointments with any firm,"" my father",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Mother smiled approvingly--Tim, a little sadly. He was the only one",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"who didn't seem pleased by what had happened to me, even though he'd",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,prophesied it.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia slipped her arm through mine. ""The agency wondered whether you",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"wouldn't give them a testimonial for Panacetic Pills, Kev,"" she said,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"squeezing my arm. ""They'd pay a lot, and the rest of the family sure",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"could use the money if you're too high-minded to accept it.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I couldn't do a thing like that, Sylvia. It wouldn't be ethical.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Why wouldn't it be?"" She dropped my arm. ""The pills couldn't possibly",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"hurt anybody. Maybe take a little business away from Mother, but Mother",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"doesn't mind, do you, dear?""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Mother frowned.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""But people would think the pills had my healing powers,"" I explained.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""I would be breaking faith with myself if I shilled for them.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Sylvia snorted. ""Breaking faith with himself. Look who's talking!""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Sylvia,"" my mother said. ""Please.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,But Sylvia went on--she was in an overwrought state because her guy,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"hadn't called her, though that was no reason to take it out on me.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Who needs healing power now? The machines can cope with all peacetime",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"ailments. Better take your loot while the getting's good, Kev.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""Nevertheless, Kevin is right, Sylvia,"" my mother said. ""He mustn't",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"prostitute his talent.""",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"""And we don't actually need the money the testimonial could bring in,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,Tim sighed.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"The months went on. Once again there was nothing for me to do, only",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,it was worse for me now because I had tasted usefulness and fame.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,People did come for a while with their headaches and cut fingers for,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"me to heal, and I was happy healing them until I realized they were",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,just coming to make me feel good. They didn't really need me. Anybody,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,who had anything seriously wrong with him went to a psychiatrist or a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"machine, same as always. I healed them too quickly for them to have",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,time to take pleasure in it. They couldn't talk for days about a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,three-second operation.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"By and by, even the cut fingers didn't come. Maybe I hadn't been",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,exactly gracious toward the end. Maybe the whole thing was my fault.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"Even the Lucy business. My mother said it was, anyhow.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"I went to see her a few times, and then she came to meet my family.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,Once.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"It was a ghastly evening. We all sat around stiffly, my family being",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"excessively polite to her, thinking, I knew, that this was my only",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"chance to get myself a wife and so they'd better be nice to the girl,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,no matter what she was like. And seeing her with what I fancied to,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"be their eyes, I realized that she wasn't outstandingly pretty,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"particularly bright, or even very talented.",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,And what was she thinking? That she had got herself virtually engaged,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,to a useless half-sense because he had had a brief moment of glory as a,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"war hero? Trapped with this imbecile and his dull, stuffy family, and",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,not being able to get out of it without being cruel?,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,What were they _actually_ thinking? I didn't know. But _they_,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"did--Mother knew what everybody was thinking, right down to the last",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,convolution of the subconscious mind and Sylvia knew what everyone else,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"was feeling, and the others ... they knew or at least sensed part of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"what was going on. But I was impercipient, I couldn't tell anything, I",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"was excluded--out in the cold--and, being unable ever really to know,",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,was forced to draw the worst conclusions.,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,I took Lucy home that evening. They had to trust me that far alone,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,because it would have looked absurd for Danny or Tim to come along as,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"chaperone, and anyway I had been there alone before, when I had gone to",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"so much as kissed her--I felt lonelier now, without even the hope of",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

49838,"park again, brooding over the power that might have been mine, if",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,only I hadn't been such a damn fool as to give freely without asking,Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"anything in return. During the war, I could have got anything I wanted",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."
49838,"in exchange for what I'd done, or, rather, for what I could do, but I'd",Jack of No Trades,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,but he so seldom had a visitor that he could hardly be blamed for his,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"forgetfulness. Frowning, he pressed the viewer button. A round, red",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"face appeared on the screen. ""May I be the first to congratulate you,",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"Mr. Schnee?"" it said.",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"""You may, indeed,"" Gervase replied. ""But for what?""",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""You haven't heard the news? Good, then I'm the first. I imagine I",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,got a head-start on the others because of my superior facilities for,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"""I haven't heard any news for days,"" Gervase said, uncomfortably",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"conscious that he was apologizing. ""I've been listening to my",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"He struggled with the door-stud, but the door refused to open. The",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,autobursar must have neglected to pay the door bill--probably because,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,Gervase had failed to put enough money into it. But his allowance was,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"limited and sound-tapes, not to speak of meditators, were so expensive.",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"Sighing, Gervase got up and opened the door manually. The individual",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"outside was short and stout and dressed, unfortunately, in the uniform",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"of an upper-echelon salesman. Gervase had been caught! Still, he",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"reminded himself, no one could force him to buy anything. He was a free",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""Well, come in if you must,"" he said grudgingly. ""I suppose the big",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"At this point, Gervase noticed with surprise that the other wore a",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"uniform--which was, however, virtually invisible, it was so bedecked",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,with glittering and sparkling medals and decorations. Gervase waited,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,patiently while the soon-to-be-disposed-of Ruler made a speech pointing,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,out the numerous benefits and improvements his reign had brought to,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,the people. It was rather a long speech and Gervase's nose began to,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"itch. He would have liked to scratch it, but the cameras were pointing",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"directly at him. Life as Ruler, he saw, was going to be a long series",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,of similar repressions. He sighed. But what could he do? Nobody could,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,go against the Prognostications.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,one that came before him--Shinnick. You died before I was born--that,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"Ex-Overlord Shinnick smiled. ""We're not precisely dead--only retired,",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"together.""",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"Moorhouse put in eagerly, ""assuming that your successor is of as",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"""You'd better hurry."" Gervase worriedly changed the subject as he",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""Grave-robber,"" said Kipp, reluctantly sitting up on his catafalque and",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"When the little procession had left, Gervase pressed a stud on the desk",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,marked _Secretary_. A panel in the wall opened and a timorous-looking,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"man virtually fell into the room. ""Y-yes, Your Honorship?""",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""The Prognosticator is right here in the Palace, isn't it?"" Gervase",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"asked, in a tone that would have been authoritative if his voice hadn't",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,cracked right in the middle of _Palace_.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"As they left the room, Gervase picked the Florea Semper Fidelis Gun",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,off the desk. It was too valuable a piece of property to leave lying,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,around. The Palace was full of sticky-fingered civil servants.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,They passed through room after room containing bank after bank of,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"computing machines, each more complicated in appearance than the last.",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,Hordes of officials in the garb of hereditary scientist or technician,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"bowed low as the new Ruler passed. The machines, of course, operated",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"and repaired themselves automatically; nonetheless, they needed a good",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,many attendants as befitted their exalted status.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,Gervase and his guide finally came to the room where the Prognosticator,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,itself was enshrined. The apartment was twenty stories high and a,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"hundred meters wide, but it was none too large for all the flashing",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,lights and spinning dials and buzzing relays and levers and cables,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,which jammed it. The hundreds of first-rank scientists who waited upon,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,the Machine stopped their tasks of dusting and polishing to greet the,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,new Usurper with deferent acclaim.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""Leave me,"" he ordered, gesturing with the gun toward the door. ""I",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"would be alone with the Prognosticator.""",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""Certainly, Your Honorship. Certainly. Your wishes are our commands.""",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,They backed out.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""You, too,"" Gervase told the secretary who had guided him.",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"""Y-yes, Your Honorship."" The man skittered off.",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"When they had all gone, Gervase approached a small, unobtrusive door",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"marked _Danger--No Admittance_. Dust lay thick on the sill, for it was",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,seldom opened.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"Gervase took a tiny, intricate piece of metal from his pocket and",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,fitted it into the lock. Something inside clicked. The door swung open.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"Beyond, a narrow flight of steps spiraled downward. Gervase descended",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,them unhesitatingly until he came to another small door. This one was,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,simply marked _Private_. He knocked on it.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"The door swung open creakily. Through the gloom inside, there could be",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,dimly seen antique furnishings in a poor state of preservation and a,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,still more imperfect state of cleanliness. An outmodedly streamlined,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,twentieth-century typewriting machine was set on a costly metal stand,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,with one caster missing. The flaps of the table were open--one held a,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"chipped teapot, the other a dusty crystal ball and a dog-eared pack of",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"Gypsy cards. Behind all this was a rare old psychoanalyst's couch,",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,ripped open here and there and showing the original stuffing.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,Reclining on the couch was an incredibly old woman wearing a quaint,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"costume of a bygone era--long scarlet silk skirt, yellow blouse, great",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,golden hoops swinging in her ears. She was sipping something out of a,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"teacup, but it didn't smell like tea, at least not like tea alone. The",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,ancient reek of gin pervaded and overpowered the general mustiness.,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,,Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51050,"""Hello, son!"" the old woman said, waving the cup at Gervase. ""'Bout",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"""Aah, I got tired of supporting you! You're a big boy--it's about time",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51050,"elect a sympathetic administration. Sympathetic to me, that is. Palace",Man's Best Friend,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"corporeal being, all the aspects of his personality wallowing in the",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,luxury of a day off. How glad he was that he'd had the forethought to,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,stipulate a weekly holiday for himself when first this godhood had,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"been thrust upon him, hundreds of centuries before. He'd accepted the",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,perquisites of divinity with pleasure then. It was some little time,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"before he discovered its drawbacks, and by then it was too late; he had",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"All the aspects of his personality rested ... save one, that is. And",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"that one, stretching out an impalpable tendril of curiosity, brought",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,back to his total consciousness the news that a spaceship from Earth,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,had arrived when no ship from Earth was due.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,_So what?_ the total consciousness asked lazily of itself. _Probably,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,hopeful that they would take some of the Divine Work off his hands.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"After all, since it was they who had originally established the",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"colony, it should be their responsibility. But it seemed that all",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"humans, not merely the Uxenach, were irresponsible. The Earthmen were",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,interested only in trade and tribute. They even refused to believe in,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"True, Uxen prospered commercially to a mild extent after their return,",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,for the local ceramics that had been developed in the long interval,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"Culturally, though, Uxen had degenerated under the new Earth",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"There was no tourist trade, for the planet was too far from the rest",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,of the Galaxy. The commercial spaceships came only once every three,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"months and left the same day. The two destroyers that ""guarded"" the",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"planet arrived at rare intervals for fueling or repairs, but the crew",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,never had anything to do with the Uxenach. Local ordinance forbade the,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"maidens of Uxen to speak to the outlanders, and the outlanders were not",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,interested in any of the other native products.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,But the last commercial spaceship had departed less than three weeks,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"before on its regular run, and this was not one of the guard ships.",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,Zen reluctantly conceded to himself that he would have to investigate,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"this situation further, if he wanted to retain his reputation for",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"omniscience. Sometimes, in an occasional moment of self-doubt, he",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"wondered if he weren't too much of a perfectionist, but then he",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,rejected the thought as self-sacrilege.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,Zen dutifully intensified the beam of awareness and returned it to the,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"Uxlu himself, Zen admitted grudgingly, was an imposing sight to anyone",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,who didn't know the old yio. The years--for he was a scant decade,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"younger than Guj--had merely lent dignity to his handsome features, and",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,he was still tall and upright.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"He did not, Zen noted with approval, rashly promise that requests",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"would necessarily be granted. Which was fine, because the god well",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"knew who the carrier out of requests would be--Zen the Almighty, the",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"""Yes, Your Majesty."" Every one of Zen's perceptors quivered",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"wished he could join them, but he couldn't materialize on that plane",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"without incense, and he preferred his subjects not to know that he",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"could be invisibly present, especially on his day off. Of course, his",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"Immaterial Omnipresence was a part of the accepted dogma, but there is",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"""Well, you will have to forego that pleasure,"" Zen said, frowning",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"terribly. Even the tall one cowered, he noted with appreciation. It had",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,been a long time since people had really cringed before his frown. The,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,Uxenach had come to take him too much for granted; they would learn,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"their mistake. ""From now on,"" he said portentously, ""the tobacco must",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,"Earthlings why they had come to Uxen, and to discuss a little",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,direct approach might very well be a mistake.,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51126,He hoped Iximi would make sure they burned him tobacco,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,regularly--really good stuff; almost made godhood worthwhile. But then,The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"he'd felt that way about incense at first. No, he had other ideas for",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51126,"making divinity worthwhile, and Iximi was going to help him, even if",The Princess and the Physicist,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"soldiers--enemies and allies, both--that had engulfed the country in",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,that way.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"him to call her ""_Aunt Ninian_""? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,too crazy for that.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,instead of mopping up the floor with him.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"""But I can't understand,"" he would say, keeping his face straight. ""Why",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"""Hire a maid, then!"" he jeered.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,how to give them the cold shoulder.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,hard inside.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,hired a private tutor for him. A tutor--in that neighborhood! Martin,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"without hearing ""Fancy Pants!"" yelled after him.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,spectator.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,"" she",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"declared. ""Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,And keep an eye on him she did--she or a rather foppish young man who,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Raymond.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"From time to time, there were other visitors--Uncles Ives and",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"more--all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,was supposed to know better than he did.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,more luxury than he knew what to do with.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"and a freezer well stocked with food--somewhat erratically chosen, for",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Ninian didn't know much about meals.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,nearly killed him--but then there had also been times when she'd hugged,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how--and if",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world--a,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,actually doing anything with the hands.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,normal living.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"passing laws to do away with the--well, abuses and things like that,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Conrad is so impatient.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,"" Martin suggested.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I've told you--our world is precisely the same as this one!"" Raymond",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"snapped. ""We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"He continued more mildly: ""However, even you ought to be able to",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"would they manage to live?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"do _you_ live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"you,"" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,past and think in the future.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,"" Raymond said, ""but",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"if you will persist in these childish interruptions--""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I'm sorry,"" Martin said.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or--more",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,frightening--his race had lost something vital.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond went on blandly: ""Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous--his feeling,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"accountable for his great-grandfather.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""How about a great-great-grandchild?"" Martin couldn't help asking.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond flushed a delicate pink. ""Do you want to hear the rest of this",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"or don't you?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Oh, I do!"" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"in time and ""eliminate!"" their common great-grandfather. In that way,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,"" Martin observed.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond looked annoyed. ""It's the _adolescent_ way,"" he said, ""to do",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"society in order to root out a single injustice?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Not if it were a good one otherwise.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,of eliminating our great-grandfather--because our great-grandfather,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"was such a _good_ man, you know."" Raymond's expressive upper lip",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"curled. ""So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"his great-grandfather's father--who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"worthless character.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""That would be me, I suppose,"" Martin said quietly.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond turned a deep rose. ""Well, doesn't that just go to prove you",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"mustn't believe everything you hear?"" The next sentence tumbled out in",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"a rush. ""I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us--the other",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"cousins and me--held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you."" He",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,beamed at Martin.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"The boy smiled slowly. ""Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"_eliminating_ me, then none of you would exist, would you?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. ""Well, you didn't really",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"altruism, did you?"" he asked, turning on the charm which all the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,cousins possessed to a consternating degree.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"assistants,"" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""and--ah--induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,use of the iron maiden.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go--and here",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"we are!""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I see,"" Martin said.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. ""After all,"" he pointed",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"out defensively, ""whatever our motives, it has turned into a good",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms--I don't see what more you",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,course Ninian _was_ a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"era has completely disposed of the mercantiles--""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""What did you do with them?"" Martin asked.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"But Raymond rushed on: ""Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Ostentation--that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,"" he added, ""I might",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"wretched historical stint.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""So Ninian's going,"" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her--or she, he knew, for",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,him.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"exile,"" Raymond explained, ""even though our life spans are a bit longer",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"government."" He looked inquisitively at Martin. ""You're not going to",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""No...."" Martin said hesitantly. ""Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference."" That was the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. ""I knew you weren't a sloppy",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"you know.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. ""How do you plan to",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"protect me when he comes?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,"" Raymond said",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"doubt, was a perfectly genuine--and lethal--weapon. ""And we've got a",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"rather elaborate burglar alarm system.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"dubious. ""Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this _house_,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"_time_?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Never fear--it has a temporal radius,"" Raymond replied. ""Factory",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"guarantee and all that.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Just to be on the safe side,"" Martin said, ""I think I'd better have",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"one of those guns, too.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""A splendid idea!"" enthused Raymond. ""I was just about to think of that",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried--tears at",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,very last.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,descendants were exceedingly inept planners.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle--""architecturally",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"dreadful, of course,"" Raymond had said, ""but so hilariously",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"go with a castle.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?"" Raymond asked, amused.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""No,"" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, ""but it would make the place",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"seem safer somehow.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"Martin couldn't hold back his question. ""What was I, actually, in that",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"other time?""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,There was a chilly silence.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Let's not talk about it, dear,"" Lalage finally said. ""Let's just be",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"thankful we've saved you from _that_!""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,fear--the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,walk into a man who looked like him--a man who wanted to kill him for,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,the sake of an ideal.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,pictures.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"Cousin Ives--now that Martin was older, he was told to call the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,descendants _cousin_--next assumed guardianship. Ives took his,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,interested.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Takes time,"" Ives tried to reassure him. ""One day they'll be buying",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,change of air and scenery.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,which Martin christened _The Interregnum_. They traveled about from sea,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world--mostly in fragments; the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,largely because they could spend so much time far away from the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"_The Interregnum_. He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,time.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"ship, giving each other parties and playing an _avant-garde_ form of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,having got advance information about the results.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,of their distinguished ancestry.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Rather feudal, isn't it?"" Martin asked.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"of some ocean or other. ""People, too. Mostly lower classes, except",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,"" he added",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"regretfully, ""same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,"" he corrected",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"himself. ""Maybe it _is_ worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Bombed. Very thorough job.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,"" Ives said, after",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"a pause. ""Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"people--I expect you could call them people--there. Still--"" he smiled",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I suppose not,"" Martin said.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Conrad, and even he--"" Ives looked out over the sea. ""Must be a better",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"way out than Conrad's,"" he said without conviction. ""And everything",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to--to anything,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"if it doesn't."" He glanced wistfully at Martin.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""I hope so,"" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,couldn't even seem to care.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,the future--one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,take a medical degree--but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,about the entire undertaking.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""He died for all of us,"" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Ives, ""so his death was not in vain.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,But Martin disagreed.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,The ceaseless voyaging began again. _The Interregnum_ voyaged to every,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,apart as the different oceans.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,their elders.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,for fuel or supplies--it was more economical to purchase them in that,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"era than to have them shipped from the future--he seldom went ashore,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea--and,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,that his other work lacked.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,cousin's utter disgust.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"do,"" the cousin--who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,scraping bottom now--advised.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,understand.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?"" Martin idly asked",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,the current cousin--who was passing as his nephew by now.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. ""Conrad's",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"a very shrewd fellow,"" he whispered. ""He's biding his time--waiting",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"until we're off guard. And then--pow!--he'll attack!""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""Oh, I see,"" Martin said.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"conversation, anyhow.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""When he does show up, I'll protect you,"" the cousin vowed, touching",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"his ray gun. ""You haven't a thing to worry about.""",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. ""I",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"have every confidence in you,"" he told his descendant. He himself had",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,given up carrying a gun long ago.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so _The Interregnum_,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power--fuel,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"and man and will--to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"time. _The Interregnum_ roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air--perhaps it,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,was the sheltered life--but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,hundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"the family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,hope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,"Raymond--all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,spilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,people--all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"never to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,relief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,responsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,irretrievably.,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"""You must be Conrad,"" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51337,,The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51337,"For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his",The Man Outside,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers--and",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising--a poetic,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,easy way out.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,Snaddrath depended upon imports.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"Bbulas--who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,for there was no end to the man's conceit.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,lovely and so remote.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,"" she was",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"saying in her melodious voice. ""Our resources may be small but our",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""But why is it,"" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"the corners of his eyes, ""that only the beggar wears mudshoes?""",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""Shhh,"" Cyril hissed back. ""We'll find out later, when we've",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,to feel sorry for the man.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,"" Bbulas said with",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""Rain dance!"" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"throat. ""But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,"" he",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, ""that it is not",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"such aroma!""",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""But,"" Raoul went on, ""one can have too much of even such a good thing",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,the various roles so that each person would be making a definite,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,for his planet in many ways--but wantonly starving to death as the,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"them, and stave off his doom for a while--but that would not be playing",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,much more cheaply.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,What resources it once possessed had been depleted and--aside from,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,minerals--they had never been very extensive to begin with. All,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"rice--the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm--and there, Skkiru felt,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"of saving Snaddra--and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,had come up with this program.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,not the only one who could use a library--seen accounts of societies,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"should be played out before a large, yoomping audience, but he was",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,realistic enough to see that it would be most expedient for him to give,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,a private performance for the Earthmen alone.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"On the other hand, he now knew it should be offered outside the hut,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"Fortunately, the guslat had done its work, and by the time the Earthmen",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"arrived at the door to their hut, they were alone. The rest of the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,(allegedly) most advanced species in the Galaxy--had adapted some spare,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"in truth, seem none too steady on their feet, but he was unable to",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"He was very drunk, Skkiru decided; he must be, to phrase his sentiments",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"so poorly. Unless he--but no, Skkiru refused to believe that. He didn't",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"mind Cyril's being vaguely suspicious, but that was as far as he wanted",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,him to go. Skkiru's toes apprehensively started to quiver.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""How can you say a thing like that to a primitive?"" Raoul demanded. ""If",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"he were not a primitive, it would be all right to call him a primitive,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,but one does not accuse primitives of being primitives. It's--it's,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"downright primitive; that's what it is!""",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,They were about to go inside. Skkiru had to act quickly. He slumped,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"over. Although he had meant to land on the doorstep, he lacked the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,agility to balance himself with the precision required and so he fell,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,smack into the mud. The feel of the slime on his bare feet had been bad,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"enough; oozing over his skin through the interstices of his clothing,",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,it was pure hell. What sacrifices he was making for his planet! And,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,for Larhgan. The thought of her would have to sustain him through this,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""I see the sky!"" Skkiru howled, anxious to get his prophecies over with",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,But the mud sogging over Skkiru's body was too much. The fit could be,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,continued at a later date--and in a drier location.,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,"caught in the meshes of his metal rags. ""I feel faint.""",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"""Come in and have some coffee with us,"" Cyril invited. This also was",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"part of Skkiru's plan, for he had no intention of going back across",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"that mud, if he could possibly help it. He had nothing further",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,to say that the recorders should not hear. Bbulas might object to,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"his associating with the Earthmen, but he couldn't do much if the",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51413,"association seemed entirely innocent. At the moment, Snaddra might be a",The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51413,,The Ignoble Savages,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,                There had to be a way for Sub-Archivist,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,                Clarey to get up in the world--but this,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey had checked in at Classification Center so many times that he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,came now more out of habit than hope. He didn't even look at the card,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,that the test machine dropped into his hand until he was almost to the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"portway. And then he stopped. ""Report to Room 33 for reclassification,""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,it said.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Ten years before, Clarey would have been ecstatic, sure that",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,reclassification could be only in one direction. The machine had,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,not originally given him a job commensurate with his talents; why,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,should it suddenly recognize them? He'd known of people who had been,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"reclassified--always downward. I'm a perfectly competent Sub-Archivist,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,he told himself; I'll fight.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,But he knew fighting wouldn't help. All he had was the right to refuse,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,any job he could claim was not in his line; the government would then,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,be obligated to continue his existence. There were many people who did,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,subsist on the government dole: the aged and the deficient and the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,defective--and creative artists who refused to trammel their spirits,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and chose to be ranked as Unemployables. Clarey didn't fit into those,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,categories.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Dispiritedly, he passed along innumerable winding corridors and up",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and down ramps that twisted and turned to lead into other ramps and,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,corridors. That was the way all public buildings were designed. It,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,was forbidden for the government to make any law-abiding individual,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,think the way it wanted him to think. But it could move him in any,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,the reorientation machines.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"So the corridors he passed through were in constant eddying movement,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,with a variety of individuals bent on a variety of objectives. For the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"most part, they were of Low Echelon status, though occasionally an",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Upper Echelon flashed his peremptory way past. Even though most L-Es,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"attempted to ape the U-E dress and manner, you could always tell the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"L-E, too--and there was no mistaking the Unemployables in their sober",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"gray habits, devoid of ornament. It was, Clarey sometimes thought when",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,The machine in Room 33 extracted whatever information it was set to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"receive, then spewed Clarey out and sent him on his way to Rooms 34,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"35, and 36, where other machines repeated the same process. Room 37",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,proved to be that rare thing in the hierarchy of rooms--a destination.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"There was a human Employment Commissioner in it, splendidly garbed in",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"crimson silvet and alexandrites--very Upper Echelon, indeed. He wore a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"gold mask, a common practice with celebrities who were afraid of being",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Then Clarey stopped looking at the Commissioner. There was a girl,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"sitting next to him, on a high-backed chair like his. Clarey had never",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,seen a U-E girl so close before. Only the Greater Archivists had,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"direct contact with the public, and Clarey wasn't likely to meet a U-E",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"socially, even if he'd had a social life. The girl was too fabulous",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"for him to think of her as a woman, a female; but he would have liked",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to have her in his archives, in the glass case with the rare editions.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Good morning, Sub-Archivist Clarey,"" the man said mellowly. ""Good",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"machines tell us you're the one man who can fill it. Please sit down.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He indicated a small, hard stool.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey remained standing. ""I've been a perfectly competent",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Clarey became a hollow man once more. No matter what it was, if it",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"wasn't as duly accredited Musician, it didn't matter. The machine could",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"keep him from putting his symphonies down on tape, but it couldn't keep",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,them from coursing in his head. That it could never take away from,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""What is the job, then?"" he asked dully.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"The girl, whom he'd almost forgotten, gave a little laugh. Her eyes, he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""But I think you're attractive,"" she protested. ""Honestly I do. In a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""And I wouldn't be different any more,"" Clarey finished. That wasn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"true; he would always be different. Not that he was deformed, just",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,unappealing. He was below average height and his eyes and hair and skin,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"were too light. In the past, he knew, there had been pale races and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,dark races on Earth. With the discovery of other intelligent life-forms,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to discriminate against together, the different races had fused into",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,a swarthy unity. Of course he could hide his etiolation with dye and,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cosmetics, but those of really good quality cost more than he could",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"afford, and cheap maquillage was worse than none. Besides, why should",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,It was almost unthinkable for L-E and U-E to eat together. For Clarey,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,this was an honor--too great an honor--and there was no way out of it.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Spano and the girl put on their masks; the general touched a section of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Spano was not really broadminded. Although they went to the _Aurora,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The first few mouthfuls of the food tasted ambrosial; then it cloyed,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"and Clarey had to force it down with a thin, almost astringent pale",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"blue liquid. In itself, the liquor had only a mild, slightly pungent",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"the Sky_, which, though he'd never have admitted it, was his favorite",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,program. He had no friends; nobody would miss him if he left Earth or,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"died or anything. The general's right, he thought; I might as well",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,be an alien on an alien planet. At least I'll be paid better. And he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"wondered whether, in lighter gravity, his spirits might not get a lift.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He dragged himself to work the next day. He found someone did care,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"after all. ""Well, Sub-Archivist Clarey,"" Chief Section Archivist",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"MacFingal snarled, ""I would have expected to see more sparkle in your",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"eye, more pep in your step, after a whole day of nothing but sweet",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"rest.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But--but General Spano said it would be all right if I didn't report",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"back in the afternoon.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Oh, it is all right, Sub-Archivist, no question of that. How could I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,dare to complain about a man who has such powerful friends? I suppose,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"if I gave you the Sagittarius files to reorganize, you'd go running to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"your friend General Spano, sniveling about cruel and unfair treatment.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,So Clarey started reorganizing the Sagittarius files--a sickeningly,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,dull task which should by rights have gone to a junior archivist. All,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,morning he couldn't help thinking about Damorlan--its invigorating,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"atmosphere, its pleasant climate, its presumed absence of archives and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,archivists. During his lunchstop he looked up the planet in the files.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,There was only a small part of a tape on it. There might be more in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the Classified Files. It was, of course, forbidden to view secretapes",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"without a direct order from the Chief Archivist, but the tapes were",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"locked by the same code as the rare editions. After all, he told",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"himself, I have a legitimate need for the information.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,So he punched for Damorlan in the secret files. He put the tape in the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"viewer. He saw the natives. Cold shock filled him, and then hot fury.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"They were humanoid all right--pallid, pale-haired creatures. Objective",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"viewpoint, he thought furiously; detachment be damned! I was picked",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,_because I look like one of them_!,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He was wrenched away from the viewer. ""Sub-Archivist Clarey, what is",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the meaning of this?"" Chief Section Archivist MacFingal demanded. ""You",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"know what taking a secretape out without permission means?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey knew. The reorientation machine. ""Ask General Spano,"" he said in",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a constricted voice. ""He'll tell you it's all right.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"General Spano said that it was, indeed, all right. ""I'm so glad to hear",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,you've decided to join us. Splendid career for an enterprising young,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"man. Smoke-stick?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey refused; he no longer had any interest in trying one.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Don't look so grim,"" Spano said jovially. ""You'll like the Damorlanti",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,once you get to know them. Very affectionate people. Haven't had any,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,major wars for several generations. Currently there are just a few,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,skirmishes at the poles and you ought to be able to keep away from,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"those easily. And they'll simply love you.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I don't like anyone,"" Clarey said. ""And I don't see why the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Damorlanti should like me,"" he added fairly.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I'll tell you why! Because it'll be your job to _make_ them like you.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,You've got to be friendly and outgoing if it kills you. Anyone can,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,develop a winning personality if he sets his mind to it. I though you,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"said you watched the tri-dis!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I--I don't always watch the commercials,"" Clarey admitted.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Oh, well, we all have our little failings."" Spano leaned forward,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"his voice now pitched to persuasive decibels. ""Normally, of course,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you wouldn't stoop to hypocrisy to gain friends, and quite right,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,too--people should accept you as you are or they wouldn't be worthy,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,of becoming your friends. But this is different. You have to be what,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"they want, because you want something from them. You'll have to suffer",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"rebuffs and humiliations and never show resentment.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""In other words,"" Clarey said, ""a secret agent is supposed to forget",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"all about such concepts as self-respect.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""If necessary, yes. But here self-respect doesn't enter into it. These",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"aren't people and they don't really matter. You wouldn't be humiliated,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"would you, if you tried to pat a dog and it snarled at you?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Steff, he's got to think of them as people until he's definitely given",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"them a clean bill of health,"" Han Vollard protested. ""Otherwise, the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"whole thing won't work.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Well,"" the general temporized, ""think of them as people, then, but as",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"of your mind, you'll have the knowledge that this is all a sham, that",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,someday they'll get whatever it is they deserve. You might even think,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"of it as a game, Clarey--no more personal than when you fail to get the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"gardip ball into the loop.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I don't happen to play gardip, General,"" Clarey reminded him coldly.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,gamesman.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He was put through intensive indoctrination, given accelerated courses",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Decoding and Resourcefulness, Xenopsychology and Acting.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""There are eight cardinal rules of acting,"" the robocoach told him.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""The first is: Never Identify. You'll never be able to become the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I'm only going to play one role,"" Clarey broke in. ""All I need to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,know is how to play that role well and convincingly. My life may depend,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"on it.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I teach acting,"" the robocoach said loftily. ""I don't run a charm",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"school. If you come to me, you learn--or, at least, are exposed to--all",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Clarey was glad he could absorb the languages and social structure,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,of the planet through the impersonal hypno-tapes. He had to learn,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,more than one language because the planet was divided into several,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"national units, each speaking a different tongue. Inefficient as far as",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"planetary operation went, but advantageous to him, Han Vollard pointed",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"out, because, though he'd work in Vangtor, he would be supposed to have",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,originated in Ventimor; hence his accent.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"of the nobility, and it would be risky to elevate you to the peerage.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""What kind of a job will I have?"" Clarey asked, brightening a little at",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,the idea of possibly having something interesting to do.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""They call it _librarian_. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Colonel Blynn--he's our chief officer on the planet--says that after,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"indoctrination you ought to be able to handle it.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey already knew that jobs on Damorlan weren't officially assigned,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,but that employer and employee somehow managed to find each other,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"and work out arrangements themselves. Sometimes, Han now explained,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,employers would advertise for employees. Colonel Blynn had answered,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,such a job in Vangtor on his behalf from an accommodation address in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Ventimor. ""You were hired sight unseen, because you came cheap. So they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,The trip to Damorlan was one long aching agony. Since luxury liners,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"naturally didn't touch on Damorlan, he was sent out on a service",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"freighter, built for maximum stowage rather than comfort. Most of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,time he was spacesick. The only thing that comforted him was that it,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,would be ten years before he'd have to go back.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"They landed on the Earthmen's spaceport--the only spaceport, of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"course--at Barshwat, and he was hustled off to Earth Headquarters in",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,an animal-drawn cart that made him realize there were other ailments,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Afraid you're going to have to hole up in my suite while you're with",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey glared venomously at the tall, handsome, dark young officer.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Don't worry,"" Blynn soothed him. ""I'm sure when you go back they'll be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"able to make you look exactly the way you were before.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He gave Clarey a general briefing and explained to him that the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,additional allowance he'd be receiving--since he couldn't be expected,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,to live on a Damorlant salary--would come from an alleged rich aunt in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Where'll you get the native currency?"" Clarey asked.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""We do some restricted trading with the natives, bring materials",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"thread--stuff like that. Nothing strategic, nothing they could possibly",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,use against us ... unless they decide to strangle us with our own,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,One rainy evening a couple of Earth officers hustled Clarey into a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"hax-cart. A little later, equipped with a native kit, an itinerary, and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a ticket purchased in Ventimor, he was left a short distance from a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,large track-car station.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He was so numb with fright he had to force himself to move in the right,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,direction leg by leg. He gained a little confidence when he was able to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,find the terminus without needing to ask directions; he even managed,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,to find the right chain of cars and a place to sit in one of them.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He didn't realize that this was something of an achievement until he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,discovered that certain later arrivals had to stand. He wondered why,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"more tickets were issued than there were seats available, then realized",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,the answer was simple--primitives couldn't count very accurately.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Creakily and slowly, the chain got under way. Clarey's terror mounted.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Here he was, wearing strange clothes, on a strange world, surrounded by",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"strange creatures. They aren't really repulsive, he told himself; they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,look like people; they look like me.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Some of the natives seemed to be staring at him. His heart began to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,beat loudly. Could they hear it? Did their hearts beat the same way?,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Was their hearing more acute than his? The tapes had seemed so full of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,information; now he saw how full of holes they'd been. Then he noticed,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,that the natives were staring at each other. His heart quieted. Only,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a local custom. After a while, little conversational groups formed.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"No one spoke to him, for he spoke to no one. He was not yet ready to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,thrust himself upon them; he had enough to do to reach his destination,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,successfully.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He tried to follow the conversations for practice and to keep his mind,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,off his fears. The male next to him was talking to the male opposite,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,about the weather and its effect on the sirtles. The three females on,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,his other side were telling each other how their respective offspring,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,were doing in school. Some voices he couldn't identify with owners were,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,complaining how much sagor and titulwirt cost these days. I don't know,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"why the government is so worried, he thought; they're not really very",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,human at all.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The chain had been scheduled to reach the end of its run in three,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,hours. It took closer to five. He got off at what would have been,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"around midnight on Earth, and the terminus where he was supposed to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"take the next chain was almost empty of people, completely empty of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cars. Although it was still a few minutes before his car was due, he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"was worried. Finally, he approached a native.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Is this--is this not where the 39:12 to Zrig is destined to appear?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"he asked, conscious as he uttered Vangtort aloud for the first time",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,that his phrasing was not entirely colloquial.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The native stared at him with small pale eyes and bit his middle,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"finger. ""Stranger, eh?"" he asked in a small pale voice.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes."" The native waited. ""I come from Ventimor,"" Clarey told him. Nosy",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Clarey realized what he hadn't noted consciously before--the natives,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,spoke much more softly than Earthmen. Local custom two.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""You'll be finding things a lot different here in Vangtor,"" the native",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"The native lifted a chronometer hanging around his neck. ""Ought to get",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"in around 40 or so,"" he said. ""Whyn't you get yourself a female or a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey was very hungry. But, as he got near the food booth, the stench",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and the sight of the utensils were too much for him. He went back to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,the carways and sat huddled on a banquette until his chain came in at,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,40:91.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The car he picked was empty, so he stretched out on the seat and slept",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"until it got to Zrig, very early in the morning. When he got out,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,day was dawning and a food booth hadn't had time to accumulate odors,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,so he climbed to one of the perches and pointed to something that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,looked like a lopsided pie and something else that looked like coffee.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Neither was what it appeared to be, but the pseudo-pie was edible and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the pseudo-coffee was good. Somehow, the food seemed to diminish his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,fright; it made the world less strange.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Where you going, stranger?"" the native asked, resting his arms on the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,top of the booth.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Katund,"" Clarey said. The other looked puzzled. ""It is a village near",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""That a fact?"" The native bit his little finger. ""You look like a city",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I should think you'd be able to do better'n that."" The native nibbled",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"at his thumb. ""What did you say you worked at?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"The native turned away and began to rinse his utensils. ""In that case,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"I guess Katund's as good a place as any.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Surely, Clarey thought, even a Damorlant would at this point rise up",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and smite the food merchant with one of his own platters. Then he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,forgot his anger in apprehension. What in the name of whatever gods,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,they worshipped on this planet could a librarian possibly be?,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He got up and was about to go. Then he remembered to be friendly and,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,The omnibus for Katund proved to be nothing but a large cart drawn by a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,team of hax. Clarey waited for internal manifestations as he rode. None,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"came. I've found my land legs, he thought, or, rather, my land stomach.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And with the hax jogging along the quiet lanes of Vangtor, he found",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,himself almost at peace.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Earth was completely urbanized: there were the great metropolises;,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,there were the parks; there were the oceans. That was all. So to him,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the Vangtort countryside looked like a huge park, with grass and trees",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"and flowers that were slightly unrealistic in color, but beautiful just",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the same--even more, perhaps. It was idyllic. There's bound to be some",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"catch, he thought.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The other passengers, who'd been talking together in low tones, turned",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"toward Clarey. ""You'll be the new librarian, I take it?"" the tallest",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"observed. He was a bulky creature, wearing a rich but sober cloak that",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,came down to his ankles.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,For a moment Clarey couldn't understand him; the local dialect seemed,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to thicken the words. ""Why, yes. How did you know that?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The native wiggled his ears. ""Not many folks come to Katund and a new",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"look my idea of a librarian.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey nervously smoothed the dark red cloak that covered him from,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""What give you the idea of comin' to Katund?"" the oldest and smallest",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Is it right to have a librarian that isn't all there?"" the proprietor",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Clarey was glad when a cluster of domes appearing over the horizon,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Might as well,"" the colonel said, flipping the switch again. ""Pity we",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"don't have a probe here. Would save so much time. But, of course, it's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Well, the archives--the library--was in a real mess. Took me over two",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,weeks to get it in even roughly decent shape. Three different systems,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Not so much the library, old chap. Leave the technical stuff for",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,later. What I meant was your first impressions of the natives....,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Is something wrong with the coffee? And you've hardly touched your,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Well,"" Clarey began again, ""at first I was a bit surprised that",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,you'd stuck me in a quarter-credit place like Katund. Naturally in a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"village the people'd be more backward than in the cities, so you'd",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,have a poorer idea of how they were developing. Then I realized that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you couldn't help putting me there, that you probably couldn't write a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,letter good enough to get me a job in any of the big centers. Embelsira,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Not much. What I mean is, nobody in Katund's actually had any contact",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"with them, though they've heard of them, of course. Every now and then",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,there's a little article in the Dordonec Bulletin from their Barshwat,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"into the pot. ""Demi-gods? Superior beings? Are they in great awe of us?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""They regard us as visitors from another planet,"" Clarey said. ""They",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"don't realize from quite how far away we hail, think it's only a matter",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"of a solar system or two, but they've got the general idea. Don't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,having machines to fly in the sky and none to go on the ground. There's,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"he was expected to join the men in the bar parlor every evening, where",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,they'd drink and exchange appropriate stories. But he'd choked on the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,squfur and was insufficiently familiar with the local mores to be able,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to appreciate the stories, let alone tell any. He'd concentrated on",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"smiling and agreeing with whatever anybody said, with the result that",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the others began to agree with Piq that he was a bit cracked. ""They",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"a lovely place Katund was, so much cleaner and prettier and friendlier",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"He stopped, took a sip of tea, and continued, ""The females were",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,apologized for any inconvenience I might have caused. He said not to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,worry; Mundes had had it coming to him for a long time and his one,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,regret was that he hadn't been there to see it. Then we touched toes,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and he said he liked to see a young fellow with brawn who also took,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,an interest in cultural pursuits like reading. He trusted I'd have a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,beneficial effect on the youth of the village. And then he asked me to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""The ulerin is extremely difficult,"" the boy said importantly. ""It",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,takes years and years of practice. And you've got to have the touch to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"begin with. Not many do. All our family have the touch, my brother Irik",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"most of all. He's in Barshwat, studying to be a famous musician.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey looked at the ulerin with unmistakable wistfulness.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Care to try it?"" the boy asked. ""But, mind, you have to pay for any",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"bladders you burst.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I shall be very careful,"" Clarey said, taking the instrument",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,reverently in his hands. He had never touched a musical instrument,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"before--an Earth instrument would have been no less unfamiliar, no more",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"wonderful. Gently he began to pluck and bang and blow, in imitation of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the way the boy had done, and, though the sounds that came out didn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"have the same smoothness, still they didn't fall harshly on his ears.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The others stopped talking and listened; it would have been difficult,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"for them to do otherwise, as he was unable to find the muting device.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Sounds like the death wail of a hix,"" Piq sibilated, but he added",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"grudgingly, ""Foreigner or not, I have to say this for him--he's got the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"touch.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes, he's got the touch,"" others agreed. ""You always can tell.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Rini smiled at Clarey. ""I believe you do. I'll teach you to play, if",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you like.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I would, very much."" Clarey was about to offer to pay for the lessons;",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"then he remembered that, though this would have been the right thing",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"on Earth, it would be wrong on Damorlan. ""If it is not too much",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"trouble,"" he finished.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""It's the kind of trouble I like."" The boy twisted his nose at Clarey.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Sometime you can hide the reserved books for me.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"After the guests had gone, Clarey insisted on helping the women with",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the putting away. ""Well, as long as Embelsira has a pair of brawny arms",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to help her,"" the widow yawned, ""I might as well be getting along to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"my pallet. I seem to get more and more tired these days--old age, I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,expect. One day I'll be so tired I'll never wake up and Embelsira'll,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"be alone and what'll she do, poor thing? Who can live on a librarian's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"salary? Now, on two librarians' salaries--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Mother,"" Embelsira interrupted furiously, ""you go to bed!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She did, hurriedly.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Don't worry, Embelsira,"" Clarey said. ""She will be weaving away for",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"decades yet. Everybody says she's the best weaver in the district,"" he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"added, to change the subject.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes,"" Embelsira said as they gathered all the oddments the guests had",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"left, ""she's been offered a lot of money to go work in Zrig. But she",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"won't leave Katund; she was born here, and so were her parents.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I do not blame her for wanting to stay,"" he said. ""It's a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"very--homelike place.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She sighed. ""To us it is, but I don't suppose someone who's city born",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and bred would feel the same way. I know you won't let yourself stay,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"buried here forever, and what will I--what will Mother and I ever do",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"without you?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""It is--very kind of you to say so,"" he replied. ""I am honored.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The girl--she was still young enough to be called a girl, though",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,no longer in her first youth--looked up at him. Blue eyes could be,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"pleasing in their way. ""Why are you always so stiff, so cold?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I am not cold,"" he said honestly. ""I am--afraid.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""There is nothing to be afraid of. You're safe, among friends, no",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I have done nothing back there,"" he said. ""Nothing at all. Perhaps",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"that is the trouble with me.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She looked up at him and then away. ""Then isn't it about time you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"started to do something?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The next time he went to Barshwat he took a lot of luggage with him,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"because, besides the artifacts and the flora and fauna, he brought",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cold pastries for the colonel. The colonel ate one in silence, then",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"said, ""Try to get the recipe.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""By the way,"" said Clarey, ""the X-T boys made a few mistakes. The bugg",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,isn't an insect; it's a bird. And the lule isn't a bird; it's a flower.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And the paparun isn't a flower; it's an insect.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Oh, well, I guess they'll be able to straighten that out,"" the colonel",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"said, licking crumbs from his thick fingers. ""We do our jobs and they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"do theirs."" He reached for another pastry.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Take good care of the bugg,"" Clarey said. ""He likes his morning seed",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,mixed with milk; his evening seed with wine. His name is Mirti. He's,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"very tame and affectionate. I--said I was bringing him to my aunt....""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He paused. ""You _are_ going to take him back alive, aren't you? You'd",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"get so much more information that way.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Wouldn't dream of hurting a hair--a feather--no, it is a hair, isn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"it?--of the little fellow's head.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey looked out of the window at the purple night sky. Then he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"turned back to the colonel. ""I've been taking music lessons,"" he said",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,defiantly.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Fine! Every man should have a hobby!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I've no music license.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Come now, Clarey. You still don't seem to realize you're on Damorlan,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,not Earth. Not a blooded intelligence man yet! There aren't any guilds,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"on Damorlan, so enjoy yourself.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Speaking of that, did you find out about--er--Earthmen and--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes, I'd meant to drop you a note, but it seemed rather odd",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"information for your aunt to be giving you. It's absolutely all right,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"old chap. Go ahead, have your bit of fun.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey was unreasonably annoyed. ""I wasn't thinking of what you're",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"thinking. I mean--well, Katund is a village and the native morality is",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"very strict in these matters.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Afraid I don't quite follow you.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey bit his finger. ""Well,"" he finally admitted, ""the truth of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"matter is I'd like to get married.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The colonel was extremely surprised. ""A legal arrangement! Is it",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,absolutely necessary? How about the females that the innkeeper's so,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"anxious to have you--ah--meet?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey didn't know how to explain. ""Their standards of cleanliness....""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"he began, and stopped. Then he started again: ""I suppose I'd like a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"permanent companion.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I don't suppose there's any real reason why you shouldn't enter into",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a legal liaison while you're here,"" said the colonel. ""After all, it",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,isn't as if the two races could interbreed. That could be decidedly,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"awkward. Who's the lucky little lady?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""My landlady's daughter,"" Clarey said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Your boss, eh? Flying high, aren't you, old chap?"" His massive hand",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"descended on Clarey's shoulder. Then he grew serious. ""Can she cook",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"like her mother?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Even better.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""My boy,"" the colonel said solemnly, ""you have my unqualified blessing.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And when I ask you to save me a piece of the wedding cake, I ask from",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the heart.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"So, when Clarey went back to Katund, he asked Embelsira to marry him",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and she accepted. The whole village turned out for the wedding. Clarey,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,managed to take some vocpix of the ceremonies for the X-Ts with a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"finger unit. I ought to get a handsome wedding present for this, he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,thought.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And, to his surprise, on the wedding day, an elaborate jewel-studded",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,toilet service did arrive from Barshwat--with the affectionate regards,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"of his aunt, who was too ill to travel. They tie up everything, he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"thought, but he knew it was a little more than simply remembering",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to pick up a loose end. The toilet set was vulgar, ostentatious,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,hideous--obviously selected with loving care and Terrestrial taste.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Everybody in Katund and a lot of people from the surrounding country,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,came to look at it. It seemed to establish his eligibility beyond a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"doubt. ""Never thought 'Belsira'd do it, and at her age, too,"" Piq was",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"heard to comment. ""But it looks like she really got herself a catch.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"What's a little weakness in the dome-top when there's money, too?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The first three years of Clarey's marriage were happy ones. He and,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Embelsira got on very nicely together and, since he was fond of her",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"mother, he didn't mind her constant presence too much. Once a week",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,he took a ulerin lesson from Rini. He practiced assiduously and made,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,progress that he himself could see was sensational. He did wish that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Rini would accept money; it would have been so much less of a nuisance,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"than replacing the music books the boy stole from the library, but he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"couldn't expect local customs to coincide with his own. The money, of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"course, didn't matter; he still wasn't living up to his allowance,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,although he was beginning to spread himself on elaborate custom-made,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cloaks and tunics. On Earth he had dressed soberly, according to his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"status, but here he felt entitled to cut a dash.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"At the colonel's request, on his next trip to Barshwat he brought his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"ulerin and taped some native melodies. ""I like 'em,"" the colonel said,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"nodding his head emphatically. ""Catchy, very catchy. Hope the X-Ts",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,appreciate them; they don't usually like music if it sounds at all,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"human."" And, catching the look on Clarey's face, ""Well, you know what I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"mean. To them, if a tune can be hummed, it isn't authentic.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,News of Clarey's skill on the ulerin spread through the countryside.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"When he played in the temple concerts, people sometimes came from as",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"far away as Zrig to hear him. Clarey was a little disturbed about this,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,because he didn't subscribe to the local faith. But the high priest,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"said, ""My son, music knows no religious boundaries. Besides, when you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"play, we always get three times as much in the collection nets.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,At the time Clarey got word from Barshwat that General Spano and the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"staff ship were expected shortly, he had risen to the post of chief",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,librarian. Embelsira had retired to keep dome and wait for the young,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"ones who would, of course, never come. Clarey had hired a hixhead of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,an assistant from Zrig to assist him; he saw now why the village had,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,originally been grateful to get even a foreigner of doubtful background,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,for the job.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I'm going to have to stay at least a week with Aunt Askush this time,""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"he told his wife. ""Legal matters. I think she's drawing up a will or",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"some such,"" he added, hoping that this would keep Embelsira happy and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Maybe it worked too well. ""But why can't I come with you? I've always",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"she's the one who wouldn't. Please don't nag me, Belsir.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Sometimes I think you're a stranger, Balt,"" Embelsira declared",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,emotionally.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes, dear, I'm a stranger, anything you say, but let me get packed.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He started folding a robe crookedly, hoping it would distract her into",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,taking over the job.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"But she leaned against the lintel, staring at him. ""Balt, sometimes I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,The only thing he allowed himself to do was put down the robe he was,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"think Piq's right--I'm just plain crazy.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""I know it isn't true. I think it's ... something else entirely. You're",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"so strange sometimes, Balt. How could somebody who comes only from the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"at him. ""It's not a shameful kind of strangeness, just a ... strange",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Well, Clarey,"" Spano said, ""you seem to be doing a splendid job. I've",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Well, I suppose not.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey tensed. ""You've got a probe on the ship?"" he asked, as if the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""That's right,"" Han Vollard said. ""It's an up-to-date model. The whole",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"He didn't sleep that night. He sat looking out of the window, knowing",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,there was nothing he could do. Embelsira was in danger--her people were,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,in danger--and he couldn't lift a finger to save them.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,There was no need to answer; she knew all the answers.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Han Vollard answered him: ""Nothing yet. You've got us a lot of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""It doesn't even matter too much that one of the natives suspects,"" Han",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""She doesn't,"" Clarey said, ""and she won't. And she won't tell anybody;",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"she'd be afraid for me."" But he wasn't all that sure. The Damorlanti",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"didn't hate Earthmen and they didn't fear them, and so Embelsira",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,wouldn't think it was a shameful thing to be. He was glad he'd already,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,On the way back home he couldn't help thinking that Han Vollard might,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,be right. It could be the best thing for him to disappear now; the best,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"thing for himself, the best thing for Embelsira. He could pretend to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"desert her--better yet, Blynn could fake some kind of accident, so her",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,feelings wouldn't be hurt. A pension of some kind would be arranged.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She could marry again, have the children she wanted so much. If he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,But she wasn't just a Damorlant female--she was his wife. He didn't,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,want to leave her. Maybe he never would have to. Hadn't Spano said that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,when his term was over he could pick his planet? He would pick Damorlan.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Vollard.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The days passed and he forgot about Han Vollard. After much persuasion,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"he agreed to give a series of concerts at Zrig, but only on condition",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,started right here in his own home village that he's always sneered at,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"for being so backward!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey smiled and clapped the boy on the neck. If it made Rini feel,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,better to think Clarey had a new style rather than that Clarey played,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"better than he did, Clarey had no objection.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey was offered the post of head librarian at Zrig, but Embelsira",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"didn't want to leave Katund, and, when he thought about it, he really",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,didn't want to either. So he refused the job and didn't bother,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,mentioning the matter to Headquarters.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"As he grew more sure of himself and his position, he allowed his wealth",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,to show. He and Embelsira moved into a larger dome. Instead of sending,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to Zrig or even Barshwat for the furnishings, they hired local talent.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Tavan, the carpenter, made them some exquisite blackwood pieces inlaid",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,with opalescent stone that everyone said was the equal of anything,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,in Barshwat. A talented nephew of Hanxi's painted glowing murals;,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Embelsira's mother wove rugs and draperies in muted water-tones. The,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,dome became the district showplace. Clarey realized he now had,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a position to keep up, but sometimes it annoyed him when perfect",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,strangers asked to see the place.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He was invited to run against Malesor as headman but declined. He,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"didn't want to be brought into undue prominence. Trouble was, as he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"became popular, he also aroused animosity. There were the girls who",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"felt he should have married them instead of Embelsira, and their",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,mothers and subsequent husbands. A lot of people resented Clarey,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"because they felt he should have decorated his house differently,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"dressed differently, spent his money differently.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"A man can live ignored by everyone, he discovered, but he can't be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,liked by some without finding himself disliked by others.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,       *       *       *       *       *,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Matters came to a head in his fourth spring there. He thought of it as,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"spring, although on Damorlan the seasons had no separate identities;",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"they blended into one another, without its ever being very hot or very",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cold, very rainy or very dry. The reason he called this time of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,year spring was that it seemed closest to perfection.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,It was less perfect that year. Because it was then that Rini's brother,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Irik came back from Barshwat, after a six years' absence. He was very",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"much the city man, far more so than anyone Clarey had seen in Barshwat",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"itself. His tunics were shorter than his fellow villagers', and his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,cloaks iridesced restlessly from one vivid color to another. He wore a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"great deal of jewelry and perfume, neither of the best quality, and the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,toes of his boots were divided.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey described this in detail to Embelsira the night Irik put in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"his first appearance at the Furbush. ""You should have seen the little",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"horror!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""That's the way city men dress,"" Embelsira told him. ""It's fashionable.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But, dear, I've been to Barshwat.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""You don't have an eye for clothes. You never notice when I put on",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,anything new. And I think it's unfair to take a dislike to Irik just,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"because you don't care for the way he dresses.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""It's more than that, Belsira."" And yet how could he explain to her",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"what he couldn't quite understand himself, that Irik was vain, stupid,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"hostile; hence, dangerous?",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I swear to you, Balt,"" Embelsira said demurely, ""that whatever there",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"was between me and Irik, it all ended six years ago.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey gave a start and then held back a smile. ""I believe you, dear.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,And he kissed her nose.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,       *       *       *       *       *,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Irik held forth in the Furbush every evening of his stay in Katund. He,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,had grievances and he aired them generously. He hated everything--the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"government, taxes, modern music, and Earthmen, whom he seemed to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"consider in some way responsible for the modern music, or at least its",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"popularization. ""Barbarians--slept completely through my concerts.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But people are always falling asleep during concerts, Irik,"" Malesor",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"pointed out reasonably. ""And how could you expect barbarians to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,appreciate good music? What do you care for Earthmen's opinions as long,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"as your own people like your music?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Irik hesitated. ""But the Earthmen have taken up the new kind of music;",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,they stay awake during that. And--a lot of people seem to think that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"whatever's strange is good, so whatever the Earthmen like eventually",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"becomes fashionable.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Hanxi wiggled his ears. ""Fashions change. Well, who's ready to have his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"mug refilled?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But the Earthmen will keep on setting the fashions,"" Irik snarled.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Many people think the Earthmen know everything, just because they're",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"aloof and have sky cars.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Well,"" Malesor said, ""the sky cars certainly prove they know",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"something we don't. Better stick to your music, boy.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The smoky little bar-parlor resounded with laughter and Irik's face,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"turned a nasty red. ""They don't know anything about music and they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,don't know everything about machinery. We might surprise them yet. A,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"friend of mine knows Guhak, the fellow who invented that new brake for",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the track car a few years ago.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""We know about that brake,"" Piq observed. ""It stops a car so good, the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"chains are twice as late nowadays as they used to be, and you couldn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"strictly say they were ever on time.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Everybody laughed again. Irik quivered with anger. ""Guhak has invented",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,a car that doesn't need to go on tracks. It can run _whenever_ it wants,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,_wherever_ it wants. And one car will be able to go faster than three,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"hax teams.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""That I'll believe when I've ridden on it,"" Kuqal grinned. ""Even",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the chains aren't that fast."" The others bit their thumbs and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"nodded--except Clarey, who was rigidly keeping out of the conversation.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He forced squfur down his tightening throat and said nothing.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""You're backward clods!"" Irik raged. ""If the Earthmen can have cars",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,that go through the sky without tracks why shouldn't we have cars that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"run on the ground the same way? Have we tried?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Doesn't seem to me it's worth the effort,"" Malesor said. ""Our cars can",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"get us where we're going as fast as we need to go already, why bother?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Whatever an Earthman can do, we can do better! Soon Guhak will get his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"ground cars on the road. After that, it'll only be a short step to cars",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,that go in the sky. Then we'll find out where the Earthmen come from,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and why they're here. We'll be as powerful as they are. We'll get rid,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"of them and their rotten music.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The bar parlor was silent, except for the clink as Clarey put his mug",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"on the table. If he held it an instant longer, he was afraid he would",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,spill it. One or two of the men looked at him uneasily out of the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"corners of their eyes. Malesor spoke: ""In the first place, you don't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"know how powerful Earthmen are. In the second place, who wants to be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"powerful, anyway? The Earthmen haven't done us any harm and they're a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,good thing for the economy. My cousin in Zrig tells me one of 'em come,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"into his store a coupla months ago and bought out his whole stock,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"every bolt of cloth. Paid twice what it was worth, too. Live and let",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"live, I say.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The others murmured restlessly.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""If there are ways of doing things better,"" Rini suggested, ""why",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"shouldn't we have them, too?"" His eyes darted quickly toward Clarey's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and then as quickly away.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Irik turned his head and looked directly at Clarey for the first time.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""You're silent, stranger. What do _you_ think of the Earthmen?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey picked up his drink, finished the squfur and set the mug back",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"down on the table. ""I don't know much about Earthmen. An ugly-looking",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"lot, true, but there doesn't seem to be any harm in them. Of course,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"living in Barshwat, you probably know a lot more about them than I do.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I doubt that,"" Irik said. ""You have an aunt in Barshwat.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey allowed himself to look surprised before he said courteously,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I'm glad you find me and my family so interesting. Yes, it so happens",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"I do have an aunt there, but she's rather advanced in years and doesn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"enjoy hanging around the starship field the way the children do.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Irik's face darkened. ""What is your aunt's name?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,This time everyone looked surprised. The question itself was not too,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"out-of-the-way, but his tone decidedly was.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""She's a great-grandmother,"" Clarey said. ""She would be too old for",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,you. And I assure you it's difficult to part her from her money. I've,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"tried.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Everybody laughed. Irik was furious. ""I understand that your aunt lives",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"very close to Earth Headquarters!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Somebody must have followed him on one or more of his trips to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Barshwat, Clarey realized. ""If the Earthmen chose to establish",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"themselves in the best residential section of Barshwat, then probably",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,my aunt does live near them. She's not the type to leave a comfortable,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"dome simply because foreigners move into the neighborhood.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Perhaps she has more than neighborhood in common with Earthmen.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The room was suddenly very quiet again.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""She does sometimes go to sleep at concerts,"" Clarey conceded.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Irik opened his mouth. Malesor held up a hand. ""Before you say anything",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"more against the Earthmen, Irik,"" he advised, ""you oughta find out more",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,about them. Their cars move faster and higher than ours. Maybe their,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"catapults do, too.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"No one looked at Clarey. Malesor had averted a showdown, he knew, but",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,this was the beginning of the end. And he had a suspicion who was,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"responsible--innocently perhaps, perhaps not. Love does not always",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,imply trust. And when he told Embelsira what had happened in the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Furbush, she, too, couldn't meet his eye. ""That Irik,"" she said, ""I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Rini writes him very often,"" she babbled. ""He must have told him you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"likes to irritate Irik, because he's always been jealous of him. But",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,the whole thing's silly. How could you possibly make over the world's,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"music, even if you were--"" Her voice ran down.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""An Earthman?"" he finished coldly. ""I suppose you went around telling",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"everybody your suspicions, and Rini wrote that to Irik, too?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""You have no right to speak of Mother like that, even if it's true!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""You could've told her to mind her own business!"" he snapped, before",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"he could catch himself. Five years, and he still made slips. It was",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"her business. On Damorlan, it was a woman's duty not only to have",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,children but to see that her children had children and their children,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,had children.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"He made himself look grave and self-reproachful. ""I have a confession",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"How primitive she is, he thought, and, then, angrily, how provincial I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"am! He had never stopped to think about it, but he knew of no married",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,couple who had not at least one offspring; he and Embelsira were the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,only ones. It hadn't occurred to the X-T specialists that a species,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,whose biological assets were roughly the same might have different,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,handicaps. Apparently there was no such thing as sterility on Damorlan.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""Then I swear not to tell,"" she said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He kissed her. After all, he thought, it isn't a lie. _I_ don't mean",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"her people any harm. Besides, sooner or later, her mother will get it",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"out of her, so she won't be keeping her part of the bargain.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The next time he went to Barshwat he knew he would be followed. He,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"tried to shake the follower or followers off, but he couldn't be sure",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,he'd succeeded.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He found the colonel looking out of the window with an expression of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"quiet melancholy. If there had been any Earthwomen on Damorlan, Clarey",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,would have thought he'd been crossed in love.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Things are taking a bad turn, Clarey,"" Blynn said. ""There have been",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,certain manifestations of hostility from the natives. Get any hint of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"it?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""No,"" Clarey said, taking his usual chair, ""not a whisper.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The colonel sat down heavily. ""Katund's too out of the way. We",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,should've moved you to a city once you'd got the feel of things. But,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you do go to Zrig occasionally. Haven't you heard anything there?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Only that an Earthman bought out a cloth merchant's entire stock at",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"one blow.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Blynn grinned weakly. ""Maybe it was rather an ostentatious thing to do,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"but the fabric's beautiful stuff.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He rubbed his nose reflectively. ""Fact is, I've been hearing disturbing",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,rumors. They say some fellow named Kuhak's invented a ground car that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"can run without tracks.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey almost said ""Guhak,"" but caught himself in time. ""Nonsense,"" he",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"scoffed. ""The more I know of them, the more surprised I am they ever",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"got as far as inventing the chains.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But they did, no getting around that. This is what Earth's afraid of,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you know,"" he reminded Clarey--unnecessarily. ""This is why you were",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"sent here. And, if the rumor's true, it looks as if you weren't needed",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"at all. I got the bad news by myself.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But why should it be that upsetting?"" Clarey tried to laugh. ""You look",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"as if it were the end of the world.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The colonel gave him a long, level look. ""I consider that remark in the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"worst of taste.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey stopped laughing.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Remember,"" the colonel reminded Clarey, again unnecessarily, ""this is",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the way we ourselves got started.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But the Damorlanti don't have to move in the same direction. They may",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"look human and even act human, but they don't think human.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The colonel clasped his hands behind his head and sighed. ""There have",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"been articles against us in the paper, and whenever we go out in the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"street people--natives, I mean--make nasty remarks and sometimes even",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,faces at us. And what have we done to them? Carefully minded our own,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"business, avoided all cultural contacts except for trade purposes, paid",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"them much more than the going price for their goods, and gave them one",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"or two tips on health and sanitation. As a result, they're beginning to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"hate us.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But if you send a report, it'll bring the staff ship in ahead of time.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Maybe the whole thing'll blow over. This way, you're not giving it a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"chance to.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The colonel chewed his lip. ""Well,"" he finally said, ""I might as well",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"wait and see if the rumor's verified before I report it.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey went back to Katund. The months went by. The friendly atmosphere,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"in the Furbush had vanished, and not as many people stopped and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,chatted when they came to the library. But there wasn't any actual,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,incident until the evening Clarey was walking home after late night at,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the library and a stone struck him between the shoulder-blades. ""Dirty",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Earthman!"" a voice called, and several pairs of feet scuttled off.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He didn't mention the incident to Embelsira, not wanting to worry her,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,but the next morning he went to the Village Dome and informed Malesor.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Very bad,"" the headman muttered. ""_Very_ bad. Whoever did it will be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"punished.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""You won't be able to catch them,"" Clarey said, ""and there'd be no",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"point in punishment, anyway. Look at it like this, Mal. Suppose I had",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"been an Earthman, don't you see how dangerous this would be, not for me",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"but for you? Can't you imagine the inevitable results?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Malesor nodded. ""The Earthmen's catapults do go farther and faster,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"then?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""And maybe deeper,"" Clarey agreed, pretending not to notice that it had",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"been a question. ""After the way Irik talked, I couldn't help drifting",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,over to the starfield when I was in Barshwat and watching an Earth ship,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,come. You've no idea how incredibly powerful a thing it was. Anyone,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"who has power in one direction is likely to have it in another.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I wonder if the Earthmen always had power,"" Malesor mused, ""if they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"weren't like us once. If, given time, we couldn't be like them....""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Clarey didn't say anything.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Malesor's pale face turned gray. ""You mean we might not be given time?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey wiggled his ears. ""Who can tell what's in the mind of an",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Earthman?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Malesor looked directly at him. ""Why do you tell me this?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Because I'm one of you,"" Clarey said stoutly.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Malesor shook his head. ""You're not. You never can be. But thanks for",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the warning--stranger.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"_Never identify_, the robocoach had said. _You'll never be able to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,become the character you're trying to play._ He was talking only of the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"stage, Clarey told himself angrily, as he left the Dome.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Reports trickled in from the cities. Earthmen had been stoned twice in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Zrig, more often than that in Barshwat. Clarey got an agitated letter",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"from his aunt. ""Watch out for yourself, Nephew,"" she warned. ""They may",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"take it into their heads to attack all foreigners. Remember, come what",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"may, you'll always have a home with me.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Then everything broke open. A group of natives attacked Earth,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Headquarters in Barshwat. The Earthmen sprayed them with a gas which,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"made the attackers lose consciousness without harming them; that is, it",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"was intended to work that way. However, one of them hit his head on the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"wall when he fell, and he died the next day.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The people of Vintnor were aroused. They milled angrily around Earth,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Headquarters carrying banners that said, ""Go home, Earth murderers!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The headman of Barshwat called upon Colonel Blynn. The colonel,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"courteously refused to withdraw his men from the planet. ""I'm under",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"orders, old chap,"" he said, ""but I'll report your request back to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Earth.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""It isn't a request,"" the headman said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Colonel Blynn smiled and said, ""We'll treat it as one, shall we?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey knew what happened, because the headman gave a report of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,conversation to the Barshwat Prime Bulletin. He also got a letter from,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,his aunt describing the incident as vividly as if she had been there,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,herself. The Barshwat Prime ran a series of increasingly intemperate,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,editorials calling upon all the nations of Damorlan to unite against,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the Earthmen; it was spirit that counted, it said, rather than",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,technology. Malesor wrote a letter asking how superior spiritual values,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,could compete against presumably superior weapons. He read it aloud,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,in the Purple Furbush before he sent it to the editor of the Barshwat,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Prime, which was lucky, because the Prime never printed it, although",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,the Dordonec Bulletin ran a copy.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,       *       *       *       *       *,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"However, the Barshwat Prime did print letters from editors in different",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,countries. All of them pledged firm moral support. It also printed a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,letter from an anonymous correspondent in Katund which alleged that,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"there was an Earth spy in that village, disguised as a Damorlant, and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,it was this spy who was personally responsible for the decline of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,musical taste on the whole planet. But the Bulletin seemed to consider,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"this merely as an emanation from the lunatic fringe: ""It would be as",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"easy to disguise a hix as one of us as an Earthman. And, although we",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"could certainly not minimize the importance of music in our culture,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,it is hardly likely that Earth would be attempting to achieve fell,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"purposes through undermining that art. No, the decline in musical taste",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,represents part of the general decline in public morality which has,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"left us an easy prey.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Irik went back to Barshwat to help riot, but he left the Katundi",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"convinced that Clarey was, if not actually an Earthman, at least a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"traitor. When he came into the Furbush, everybody got up and left.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Nobody patronized the branch library any more. The constant readers,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"went to the main library at Zrig, and, since the trip was expensive,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,their books were usually overdue and they had to pay substantial fines.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Sometimes they never returned the books at all and messengers had to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,be sent from the city. Finally the chief librarian at Zrig issued a,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,regulation that only those resident within the city limits could take,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,books out; all others in the district had to read them on the premises.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The Katundi blamed that on Clarey, too. One night they broke into his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,library and stole all the best-sellers.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"A couple of days later, he came home and found all the windows of his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"dome broken. Best-sellers are often disappointing, he thought. He found",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a note from Embelsira, saying, ""I have gone home to Mother.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He knew she expected him to go after her, but he wrote her a note",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"saying he was going to see his aunt who was terrified by all the riots,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"and put it in the mail, so she wouldn't get it too soon. He packed his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,kit with his most important possessions and he took his ulerin under,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,his arm.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"When he reached Barshwat, he had some difficulty getting through the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,crowd in front of Earth Headquarters. All the windows were boarded up,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and the garbage hadn't been collected for a considerable length of,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"time. Just as he reached the door, a familiar voice called, ""That's the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Earth spy!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Don't be silly!"" another voice said. ""He's obviously one of us!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But a traitor!"" cried another voice. ""Otherwise why go in there?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Stones splattered against the door, followed by impartial cries of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Spy!... Traitor!... Fool!"" the last seemingly addressed to each other,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,rather than Clarey.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Blynn was haggard and anxious-looking ""I've been wondering when you'd",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I'm all right,"" Clarey interrupted. ""But what are we going to do?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Blynn laughed without stopping for a full minute. ""Do? I'll tell you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""I thought we didn't want them to know about ground cars--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""They know,"" Blynn said crisply. ""They've got one of their own now,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"maybe more. Crazy-looking thing, but it works. You'll see it outside",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"Han Vollard strode into Headquarters, eyes ablaze. ""Why didn't you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,Neither Blynn nor Clarey said anything.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"do?"" he forced himself to ask.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""The decision will have to be made on Earth. Unless you mean what's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,going to happen to you? That's simple--you'll go back with us. Blynn,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"will stay here, pending orders.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,The colonel saluted.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I thought I was going to stay here ten years,"" said Clarey.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Five to ten years,"" she corrected. ""Apparently five was enough--"" She",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"cut herself short. ""What's the matter with me?"" she suddenly exclaimed.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I've been letting myself think in the same woolly way you do.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Suddenly, almost frighteningly, she smiled. ""Clarey, you _did_ the job",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,we sent you out to do! You did it better than we expected! What threw,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"me off was that we sent you out to act as an observer. Instead, you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"became a catalyst!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She seized his hand and wrung it warmly. ""Clarey, I apologize. You've",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"done a splendid job!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He wrenched his hand from her grasp. ""I didn't act as a catalyst!",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"It would have happened anyway."" His voice rang in his own horrified",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,ears--a voice begging for reassurance.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And she was a woman; she had maternal instincts; she reassured him. ""It",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"would have happened anyway,"" she said soothingly, ""but it would have",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"dragged on for years, cost the taxpayers billions.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""And now,"" he whispered, still unable to believe that the thing had",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"really happened, ""will you ... dispose of everyone on Damorlant?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She smiled and threw herself into a chair, her body limp and tired and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"contented-looking. ""Come, Clarey, we're not that ruthless. Some kind of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,quarantine will probably be worked out. We just made the whole thing,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"sound more drastic to appeal to your patriotism.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The general beamed. ""So everything has worked out all right, after all?",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"I knew it would. I always had the utmost confidence in you, Clarey.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She was busily planning. ""We'll arrange some kind of heroic",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"accident.... I have it! You died saving your aunt from the flames.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""What flames?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""The flames of the fire that burned down her house. She died of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"local equivalent of shock. Embelsira will be rich, so she'll want to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,believe the story. She'll be able to find herself another husband;,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"she'll have children. She'll be better off, Clarey.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He looked at her, his misery welling out of his eyes.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Oh, I don't mean it that way, man! All I meant was that you're a human",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,being; she's not. I'm not saying one is better than the other. I'm,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"saying they're different.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But I felt less different with her, with the Damorlanti, than with",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"anyone on Earth,"" he said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,She walked across to the window and looked out at the Damorlanti,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"rioting ineptly below. ""Most of us are happier in our dream world,"" she",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"said at last, ""but society couldn't function if we were allowed to stay",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"there.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Damorlan wasn't a dream world.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But it will be,"" she said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,And so Clarey went back to Earth on the staff ship. Once its luxury,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,would have given him pleasure; now the cabin with its taps that gave,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"out plain water, salt water, mineral water, and assorted cordials held",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,no charm; neither did the self-contained tri-di projector-receiver. The,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,only reason he stayed there most of the time was to avoid the others.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"However, he couldn't avoid turning up in the dining salon for meals.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"The greater his sorrow, the greater his appetite.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"One day after lunch, Han stopped him forcibly, grasping his arm. ""I've",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,got to talk to you. Afterward you can go off and sulk if you want to.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,But we're going to make planetfall in a few days. It's necessary to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"discuss your future now.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I have no future,"" he said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Come this way, Clarey. That's an order!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Obediently, he followed her into a lounge that was a dazzle of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"color and splendor. There were eight pseudo-windows, each framing a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"pseudo-scene of a different planet at a different season. The harsh,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"barren summer of Mars, the cold, bleak winter of Ksud, the gentle green",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"spring of Earth.... It must be a park, he knew; in no other place on",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Earth could spring be manifest--and yet it gave him a little pang to,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"look at it. He tore his eyes away to turn them toward the others, and",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"then up at the domed ceiling, fashioned to resemble a blue sky with",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,clouds drifting across it. A domed ceiling ... and he thought of the,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"domes of Damorlan, light-years away among the stars....",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I'm afraid the dcor's a bit gaudy,"" Han apologized. ""We didn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,check the decorator's past performance until it was too late. But,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"it's comfortable, anyway. Try one of these chairs. They accommodate",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"themselves to the form.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,She threw herself on a chaise lounge that accommodated itself perfectly,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to her form. She wasn't wearing her usual opulent secretarial garb, but",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,something simple of clinging stuff that occasionally went transparent.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"So we're back to the first movement, Clarey though wearily.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He made sure that the chair opposite her was old-style before he,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"lowered himself into it. ""Where's the general? I thought he always sat",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"in on these conferences.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""The formalities are over now,"" she said, smiling up at him. ""Besides,""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"she added, ""if he doesn't take a nap after lunch, it wreaks havoc with",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"his digestion. Afraid to be alone with me, Clarey?"" she asked huskily.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Yes,"" he said, rising, ""as a matter of fact, I am, now that you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"mention it.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She sat up. ""Sit down!""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He sat down.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She didn't recline again. Her dress went opaque, but her voice grew",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"silken once more. ""Listen, Clarey, I don't want you to think we're",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,cheating you out of anything we promised. Even though you stayed only,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"five years, you're going to have it all. You'll have U-E status--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""What do I want that for?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Doesn't it mean anything to you any more, Clarey? It used to mean a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Did it?"" He forced his thoughts back through time. ""I suppose it did.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"But I've changed. You know, those five years on Damorlan seem like--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Like a lifetime,"" she finished. ""Couldn't we dispense with the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"clichs?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""On Damorlan the things I said were fresh and interesting. On Damorlan",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,I was somebody pretty special. I'd rather be a big second-hand fish in,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a small primitive puddle. Isn't there some way--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""No way at all, Clarey! The puddle's drying up. We've got a nice",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,She closed her eyes and sank back into the chair which arched to meet,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the arch of her body. Lying down, she didn't look nearly as tall. ""All",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"right, let's give the whole opera one final run-through. Nobody cared",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,for you on Earth; on Damorlan your friends liked you; your wife loved,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,you. On Earth you never felt welcome and/or appreciated; on Damorlan,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you felt both welcome and appreciated. On Earth--""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He was stung out of his apathy. ""That's right! I'm not saying I'm",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""How about trying to look at it from another point of view? Did it ever",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"occur to you that, if the Damorlanti accepted you, so might your own",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"people, if you approached them in the same way? Did you ever _try_ to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"make friends on Earth?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""But on Earth I shouldn't have to. They were my own people.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"""I mean--well, General Spano said it would be wrong to stoop to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He had to stop for a moment before he could bring out an answer. ""It",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,started out as a sham--but I really got to like them afterward. Then,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"it was real.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""So then you weren't a hypocrite, Clarey."" Her voice grew more",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"resonant. ""Open yourself to people, show them that you want to be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,"It was a U-E identcube, made out in his name. He had only seen them at",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a distance, and now he was holding one warm and gleaming in his hand,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,with his name and his face in it. His face ... and yet not his face.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""That's what you're going to look like when the plastosurgeons get",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"through,"" she explained. ""They'll pigment your eyes and skin and hair,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,and they may be able to add a few inches to your height. Though I think,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"you actually have grown a little. Something about the air, or, more",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"likely, the food.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Embelsira thought I was handsome the way I was. Embelsira....""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,But Embelsira was light-years away. Embelsira was part of a fading,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,dream--and he was awakening now to reality.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Look at the cube. Look at your status symbol.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He looked at it, and he kept on looking at it. He couldn't tear his",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"eyes away. He was hypnotized by the golden glitter of it, the golden",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"meaning of it. ""Musician,"" he said aloud. ""Musician...."" A dream word,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"a magic word. He hadn't thought of it for years, but this he didn't",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"have to reach back for. Once touched on, it surged over him, complete",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,with its memories.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,       *       *       *       *       *,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"But she had made it meaningless, too. He managed to tear a laugh out of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"his throat. ""Spano said I'd be able to buy the Musicians' Guild when I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,had my million and a half. Apparently you've been able to bargain them,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"down.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""This cost nothing except the standard initiation fee,"" she told him.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""You came by it honestly--through your music, nothing else. And you",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"have more than a million and a half credits, Clarey--nearly ten times",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"that, with more pouring in' every day.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,She touched a boss on the side of her chair and white light hazed,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"around them. ""I think we're close enough to Earth to get some of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"high-power tri-dis,"" she said, ""although we can't expect perfect",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"reception.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Blurrily, a show formed--a variety show. At first it seemed the same",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"sort of thing that he remembered dimly, more interesting now because",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,it had almost the character of novelty. Then an ornate young man,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,appeared and it took deeper significance. He was carrying a musical,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"instrument--refined, machined, carefully pitched. He played music on",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"the ulerin while a trio sang insipid Terrestrial words. ""Love Is a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Guiding Star"" they called it, but that didn't matter. It was one of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,tunes Clarey had taped.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She touched another boss. The blur reformed to a symphony orchestra,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"playing as background music to a soloist with another ulerin. ""That's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"your First Ulerin Concerto,"" she said. ""There are three more.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Another program was beginning, an account of the tribulations of an",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,unfortunate Plutonian family. It faded in to the strains of ulerin,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"music, to a tune of Clarey's. If they could have endured it to the end,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"she told him, it would have faded out the same way. ""Every time they",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"play it,"" she said, ""somewhere on Earth a cash register rings for you.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"And this one's a daily program.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He watched transfixed and transfigured as program after program,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"featured his music, his ulerin.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Not just on Earth,"" Han said, ""but on all the civilized planets, even",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"in a few of the more sophisticated primitive ones. You're a famous man,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey. Earth is waiting for you, literally and figuratively. There'll",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,be ulerin orchestras to greet you at the field; we sent a relay ahead,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"to let them know you were coming.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"But his mind was slowly alerting itself. ""And where am I supposed to be",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"coming from, then, since they're never to hear about Damorlan?""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""They've been told that you retired to a lonely asteroid to work--to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"perfect your art and its instrument.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Of course they couldn't divulge the truth about Damorlan. ""It seems a",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"little unfair, though,"" he said.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Why unfair? After all, Clarey, the music is yours. You took Damorlan's",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,melodies and made them into music. You took their ulerin and made it,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"into a musical instrument. They're all yours, every note and bladder of",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"them.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She reached over and put out a hand to him. ""And I'm yours, too,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey, if you want me,"" she breathed. There was obviously no doubt in",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"her mind that he did want her. And in his, too. One didn't reject the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,Secretary of Space.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,He took the chilly hand in his. The skin was odd in texture. I'm,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"imagining things, he thought. It's a long time since I touched a human",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,female's hand.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""I must be a very important Musician,"" he said aloud.",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."

51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"She nodded, not pretending to misunderstand. ""Yes, important enough to",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"rate the original and not a reasonable facsimile. You're a lucky man,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"Clarey."" And then she smiled up at him. ""I can be warm and tender, I",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"assure you.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,It took him a moment to realize what she meant. For a moment he had,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"that pang again. She would never be the same as Embelsira, but a man",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,needed change to develop.,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"He was still troubled, though. ""I want to do _something_. Even an empty",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"gesture's better than none at all. The last few months, I started",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,putting together a longer thing; I guess it could be a symphony. When I,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"finish it, I'd like to call it the 'Damorlant Symphony.'""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""Why not?"" she said. He thought she was humoring him, but she added,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""They'll think you just picked the name from an astrogation chart.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,,Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"In a final burst of irony he dedicated the ""Damorlant Symphony"" to the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"human race, but, as usual, he was misunderstood. In fact, one of the",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"music critics--all of whom were enthusiastic over the new work--wrote,",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
51867,"""At last we have a great musician who is also a great humanist.""",Sentry Of The Sky,"Smith, Evelyn E."
